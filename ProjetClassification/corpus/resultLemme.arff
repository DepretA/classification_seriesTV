'animation_domination_high-def','I remember a day when the <unknown> be controversial . there be a time when people would gnash their tooth over Bart \'s inappropriate behavior and Homer \'s penchant to strangle the lad . I recall news storey and even a protest or two . now , of course , the <unknown> be consider by many to be solid family <unknown> sweet ( if sarcastic ) look at all that make America \'s nuclear unit the nutty parfait they be . and sometimes , look back on those day of outrage in the early 1990s , I wonder : have the <unknown> get well ? or do it just look good by comparison ? a powerful argument for the latter may be Fox \'s <unknown> <unknown> <unknown> . call <unknown> for short , this new entertainment venture start off on the Internet as a cache of unrelated , often <unknown> ( not safe for work ) animated short . now Fox have find a home for it on the <unknown> hour-long block after ( but not too far after ) Saturday night \'s primetime programming . the @card@ to <unknown> cartoon <unknown> will apparently rotate in and out of the lineup with the idea that some could become their own primetime show . just like the <unknown> . ( Fox \'s website suggest that " Axe <unknown> " and " High School USA !

" and , indeed , <unknown> be plenty <unknown> far bad than even the already repugnant Family Guy . " High School USA ! " be particularly troubling . it be a tweak of the innocent Archie comic of yesteryear , with high schooler graphically revel in sex , drug and bad <unknown> with a satirical tongue in cheek , of course , but without a discernible moral anywhere . " Axe <unknown> " be less <unknown> rate <unknown> rather than the <unknown> that have be assign to " High <unknown> it be hardly <unknown> viewing material . the storey ( which we be tell sprout from the mind of artist Ethan Nicolle \'s <unknown> brother , <unknown> ) be violent , almost always free of any real positive message and sometimes revolting : a recent episode feature the titular Axe <unknown> battle an army of <unknown> feces . it could get bad .

'star_wars','on May @card@ , @card@ , George Lucas change the cinematic world forever with a little movie that reconfigure our cultural understanding of the word blockbuster . since then , Star Wars have be eclipse at the domestic box office by only a handful of other movie <unknown> and I seriously doubt they will be make cartoon about <unknown> nearly @card@ year from now . which bring us to Star Wars : the <unknown> Wars , a <unknown> show birth by <unknown> Network with an auspicious theatrical premiere in @card@ . now the entire <unknown> sixth and final season arrive on <unknown> ( on March 7 , @card@ ) . Star Wars cognoscenti , of course , wo n\'t need a history lesson to explain where the titular <unknown> war fit into the franchise \'s timeline . for everyone else , a bit of <unknown> be in order : the series chronicle the heroic exploit of <unknown> Skywalker , <unknown> <unknown> and ( for much of its run ) feisty <unknown> <unknown> Tano during the three-year span between the live-action film Attack of the <unknown> and <unknown> of the Sith . the Jedi warrior fight on behalf of the <unknown> Republic against the rogue <unknown> army of the confederacy of Independent <unknown> commonly know as the <unknown> by <unknown> Count <unknown> and the <unknown> menace General <unknown> . together , their adventure span the galaxy , from <unknown> to <unknown> , from <unknown> to <unknown> .

" search for the truth be easy . accept the truth be hard , " read one . " in war , truth be the first casualty , " read another . and occasional deep subtext ask question about the nature of good and evil or lightly poke situational ethic . so while some episode be pretty light or even silly , other can be grim , dark <unknown> its own cartoon <unknown> violent . clone and Jedi alike be kill on the field of battle . and as the series have draw to a close , it be hard to forget that most of the Jedi we see be hurry toward their own inevitable doom . as for the mystical energy field know as the Force , my word from the <unknown> Wars movie review be still relevant when it come to the series as a whole : " clone war assume that viewer be already fully in the know regard the <unknown> energy field that the Jedi harness for good and the Sith ( dark Jedi ) for ill . there be no long , expository conversation about the nature of the Force like the one that pop up occasionally throughout the live-action film . mostly , we see how it equip <unknown> , <unknown> and <unknown> <unknown> with superhuman agility in combat . " the twist be that many young ( some very young ) fan of the <unknown> Wars animated series may have never see the movie that define such spiritual subtlety . so beyond the cartoon violence , that be a fact parent would do well to grapple with before grant carte blanche permission to travel to a certain galaxy far , far away . episode review March 7 , @card@ TV <unknown> Guidelines <unknown> : <unknown> " the unknown " a clone name <unknown> seem to lose it during a critical battle with the separatist , assassinate a Jedi master during the skirmish with a shot to the head . ( we see the dead Jedi , but not the actual death blow . ) he mumble , over and over , " good soldier follow order " and try to attack another Jedi , mystify <unknown> and <unknown> \'s clone colleague . they speculate that <unknown> fall victim to some form of biological warfare but decide the only way to know for sure be to send a <unknown> tup back to the planet <unknown> to be examine . get him there prove difficult . the separatist launch an attack on the <unknown> craft and kill everyone aboard .

" the underlie message here be that the good way to deal with bully be to stand up to them . most of the battle scene involve living , breathe combatant on both side ( as oppose to <unknown> ) .

'gravity_falls','imagine <unknown> ride , its character , its <unknown> employee . now imagine a place exactly like <unknown> without the ride , the character or the <unknown> employee . imagine that the only thing remain of the <unknown> Place on Earth be a tacky gift shop with a fez-wearing con man count cash up front and a dank , fake freak show out back . you have just imagine the <unknown> Shack , the main setting for Disney Channel \'s animated <unknown> Falls . the main player in this supernaturally ting toon be 12-year-old twin Dipper and Mabel Pines , live and work for the summer under the tutelage of their great uncle ( or , as the show say , " <unknown> " ) Stan . it be he who run the <unknown> Shack and populate it with all manner of fabricate distraction , include muscle-bound <unknown> ( which he call " Six <unknown> " ) , wax statue and " <unknown> wolf boy " ( actually , Dipper plaster in dog hair ) . it be he who make the Shack a tourist trap that even P.

Dipper and Mabel go on <unknown> adventure , engage in 12-year-old infatuation and learn only the thin of moral at the end of each episode . <unknown> <unknown> his obvious affection for Dipper and <unknown> perhaps the bad TV role model this side of J. R. Ewing . slippery spiritual <unknown> bit of it play for giggle and <unknown> magic , incantation and crystal with the power to alter the world around them . Stan \'s hat evoke the idea of masonic headgear , and we see other such icon scatter across the landscape . on the positive side of the ledger , the world of <unknown> Falls do n\'t douse viewer with the kind of sexual double <unknown> and teen sensibility crowd <unknown> Network \'s <unknown> Time or <unknown> Show . language do n\'t seem to go beyond the occasional " heck " or " butt . " and character seem to care for one another in their own whimsically flawed way . well , all the character who be n\'t name \' Lil Gideon , that be . he seem borrow directly from Family Guy . episode review February @card@ , @card@ TV <unknown> Guidelines <unknown> : <unknown> " Boss Mabel " Mabel tell <unknown> Stan that he could actually make more money if he be nice to his customer . so Stan make a bet with Mabel : he will leave on vacation for three day and turn the store over to her . whoever make the most money win . right away , Mabel get to the task of be nice . she encourage Soos to follow his dream of be a dancing question mark . she allow Dipper to drag in a real supernatural beastie from the forest . <unknown> . the result be disastrous .

'simpsons','my <unknown> son have never know a world without the <unknown> . Fox \'s landmark animated show , which snag its own half-hour sitcom slot back in @card@ , have spoof four sitting president , span @card@ Olympic ( summer and winter ) and survive @card@ " <unknown> of <unknown> " Halloween special . it predate the World Wide Web , a unite Germany and Forrest Gump . it have give us the Oxford English <unknown> interjection <unknown> ! while peddle literally billion of dollar of merchandise . it be now the longest-running script primetime series in American history , outlive even Gunsmoke and <unknown> . here be what all that mean : the <unknown> have be around a long <unknown> long , in fact , that this review may not be able to tell you anything you do n\'t already know about this show . you have probably already make up your mind about Homer , Marge , Bart , Lisa and Maggie . either you watch ( and consider the <unknown> to be a cogent , witty and surprisingly warmhearted satire of the American condition ) or you do n\'t ( and think the cartoon be crass , lewd and morally impair ) . To both camp , we have this to say : we could n\'t agree more . [ <unknown> asterisk here . ] whatever you think about the <unknown> , there be no question it have become an indelible part of American <unknown> because in all its paradox , it resemble America itself . it be rebellious and conservative , wayward and moral , both woefully corrupt and whimsically cool . the <unknown> be like a <unknown> mirror that may distort who we be , but there be enough of a resemblance that we instantly recognize ourselves in its crudely animate outline . in the beginning , parent and pundit lambaste the show for its crude humor and lack of viable role <unknown> T-shirt feature the grin visage of Bart and the word " underachiever and proud of it " blanket the country . the <unknown> be the family no one want to be but secretly want to visit , if only for a vacation from themselves . their show for many ( include a fledgling <unknown> publication that would soon be call <unknown> In ) be both a symptom and a cause of a steep decline in our culture . other think , " it be about time we all loosen up a bit ! " underneath it all , something else be happen . Homer and his clan , for all their many , many fault , love and care for one <unknown> still do . in some way , now in the second decade of a new century , they seem almost <unknown> old-fashioned . as our world try to now decide if <unknown> sort of <unknown> need at all , Springfield \'s first <unknown> hold together , never mind the pressure of school , work , politics , medium and the occasional natural ( or unnatural ) disaster . indeed , Homer and Marge have stick it out for good than three decade through thick and thin , sickness and health , high hair and no hair . indeed , this <unknown> family of five , for some Americans , have become shorthand for the nuclear family . but now we must come back to that asterisk insert above . because those <unknown> be nuclear in more way than <unknown> not just because Homer sometimes come home from work with radioactive trinket in his pocket . their show be still ( and increasingly so ) edgy , rebellious , lewd and crude . homer be one of the bad dad <unknown> ever . Bart \'s loud and proud when it come to underachieve . sexual double <unknown> scatter out across Springfield like so much fallout . <unknown> animated violence and gore do n\'t restrict itself to just the embed <unknown> & <unknown> Show . homer drink beer like a dehydrate water buffalo . Patty and Selma smoke like Mr. Burns \' power plant after Homer throw a wrench in the reactor . and Mr. Burns \' lovesick assistant , Smithers , would do anything to start up a whole different sort of family with his usually oblivious boss . speak of such thing , Patty " out " herself @card@ season in , and Homer have even officiate a <unknown> wedding . foreigner in <unknown> be , as London \'s Telegraph put it , downright " weird , remote and funny . " and while the <unknown> may wind up in church every Sunday ( when Homer decide to skip in one episode , his house nearly burn down by way of " judgment " ) , the overall tone of episode deal with Christianity be skeptical at good , mock at bad . ( note that creator Matt Groening be an equal-opportunity jokester in this arena . Hinduism , Judaism and Islam have all feel the searing heat of his sarcasm . ) many other pothole dot this <unknown> landscape : suicide , nudism , masturbation , bestiality , bully and drug abuse be but a few . in short ? Springfield \'s <unknown> do not exemplify an ideal family . Fox \'s <unknown> do not exemplify an ideal TV series . neither be ever intend to . and thus , this show and its family may indeed be a symptom of a culture go terribly wrong . which can make it hard to see that it be also at time a symptom of what we have do right . episode review May 4 , @card@ TV <unknown> Guidelines <unknown> : <unknown> " Brick like me " Homer and the rest of Springfield become <unknown> , form a world where " everything fit with everything else and nobody ever get hurt .

'nip_tuck','so , <unknown> have kind of a terrible reputation in the land of television -- remember all that stuff we say two month ago about this show ? Yeah , we be right . and now that the second half of Season 5 be all wrap up , I think it be safe to say that at this point the producer of the show be literally try to shame the last remain diehard fan into let go . I mean really , do anyone watch the season finale last night besides me ? Dear God ! but hey , <unknown> \'s final season be air some time in @card@ -- maybe they be pull that old trick of make us hate them so the goodbye will be easy . guess what , show ? it be work ! for those of you who bail on this formerly ... let be go with " watchable " show when the Carver show up back in @card@ , here be why you miss the most maddeningly absurd season ever ( and trust me , that be say something ! ) . 1 ) Christian have breast cancer . okay , it be not unheard of for a major character on an already soapy show to come down with a fatal disease . but whatever ( force ! ! ! ) poetic irony may have come from manly man Christian Troy come down with what be most commonly a lady \' ailment be completely destroy by the follow : his get assault and rob of his cancer drug by a <unknown> prostitute , his manipulate a breast cancer survivor \'s group for his own libido , and his poorly insert <unknown> implant go careen off towards his shoulder region in one particularly memorable scene [ Editor \'s note : with a <unknown> floozy ! - Mindy ] . however , this be the plot point from which all other <unknown> more or less spring this half of the season , and the show do sort of manage to make us ( at least me ) care about Christian \'s impending death towards the end ... so maybe this be n\'t all bad ? ( oh , just wait ... ) 2 ) Christian and Liz hook up . yes , Liz be a lesbian . and seemingly possess of half a brain and a modicum of self-esteem . so why in God \'s name be she <unknown> up with Christian , who happen to not only be a notorious Lothario , her boss , and her long-time friend but also , you know , a man ? apparently we be suppose to believe that his terminal breast cancer and occasional moment of <unknown> vulnerability be enough to make the steady character on this show ignore her sexuality and act like a stereotypical shrewish girlfriend shriek about " commitment ! " and " fidelity ! " and " do n\'t bang your trashy bar conquest in the foyer when you have invite me over for dinner ! " and then just when we think this cursed storyline be go for good ... she go and agree to marry him . why ? 3 ) major character arc ( and character ) be ignore , multiple time . there be some dramatic stuff go on this season -- Matt quest for his father \'s affection by try for medical school , Kimber as the <unknown> stage mother of her one-year-old daughter , and that 17-year-old wunderkind <unknown> Raj join the <unknown> team . however , none of these arc be even close to adequately explore during the season ( which to be fair only consist of seven episode ) : Matt \'s storyline be introduce and dispatch within a single episode , Kimber \'s arc stop and start a couple time without go anywhere , and poor Raj stick around for three episode but completely disappear after he purposely maim himself by slam his hand in a car door . perhaps if we have have a little more from these second-tier character , we could have have a little less <unknown> action ... literally . 4 ) Sean care about his child even less than usual . at the good of time , Sean do n\'t pay much attention to his teenage daughter Annie and toddler son <unknown> . but this season give them barely a nod , with Julia take them to New York ( and can someone explain why ? ) in the third episode and Sean just kind of ... let them go . oh wait , there be that phone call Sean get from Julia a couple episode later about not pay Annie \'s school fee ... that totally make up for it ! I mean , these former series regular do n\'t even get to show up in the season finale . even Christian \'s adopt son Wilber get more screen time ! but maybe this be because the actor who play Wilber be just about the cut child ever on TV ( yes , Gosselin brood , that include you ) . who know ? 5 ) big question from last season be leave unanswered ... until the third episode , when they be answer way too quickly . reality check time : Julia <unknown> Her Memory in the previous season finale because she Got <unknown> . by the <unknown> <unknown> of Olivia , her <unknown> Lover . these be big thing , <unknown> ! do n\'t make us wait through two episode before we find out what the hell happen with all this ! oh right , you have that lame explanation in the premiere about Julia slowly regain part of her memory maybe sort of . so fine , you be ignore it . we accept that . but then you go and randomly kill off Olivia on the operate table , blame Sean for it , and bring back Eden from apparently do porn in Europe so that she could frame her dead mother for poison and shoot Julia before throw Olivia \'s ash in Sean and Julia \'s face ? ? ? ? this be a lot for one episode , even for you . 6 ) the especially <unknown> moment . <unknown> build its reputation on risqué <unknown> . and since there be @card@ scandalous episode prior to this season , it be understandable that @card@ \'s episode would have to stretch to raise the bar on this show \'s shock value . but none of this justify any of the follow antic : the baby fetish of the <unknown> student Sean be date , reveal when she put a diaper on him during sex ; guest star Jennifer Coolidge \'s character discover her black root , change her name to Coco , and perform in a rap video concern with feminine hygiene call " Yo Stank " ; one of Christian \'s conquest , obsess with the fear that she will inherit her family \'s breast cancer , chop off one of her <unknown> with an electric carving knife in the <unknown> waiting room ; the bizarre dream sequence experience by Sean after take native American hallucinogen in the desert ; and most of all , the furniture fetish that compel guest star Richard Burgi \'s character to make love to Christian \'s couch , among other inanimate object . <unknown> have go over the top before , but never quite this far over . 7 ) and most of all ... the Season <unknown> ! <unknown> traditionally go out with a bang , so it should come as no surprise to anyone that this season \'s finale contain not only cryogenics but also vampire ... or " <unknown> " , as they apparently prefer to be call . but these be the least of the shock last night , because we have to go ahead and choke down the following : Sean \'s new flame Teddy lead a double life as an anesthesiologist in Vegas and murder her lover with laugh gas ; an absurd wedding set to some freaky version of " the Very thought of you " that actually end in Liz and Christian yes , tie the knot ; Kimber decide she be still in love with Christian ( way to resurrect a dead <unknown> ! I know the vampire be here for a reason ... ) ; and Sean become addicted to nitrous ? oh , and there be one more little wrinkle . a tiny thing , really : Christian do n\'t really have terminal cancer ! he be fine -- the doctor confuse his patient id with a die woman \'s . so guess what , everybody , everything that happen already be base on nothing . nothing ! that be right , none of the crap we have to endure this season be necessary . in any way . way to kick us when we be down , <unknown> . way to go .

" ultimately , ask if private practice be good be like ask if a Twinkie be good , " write Salon \'s Heather <unknown> .

'the_knick','the first impression of the Knick , the new <unknown> drama series that begin this weekend on Cinemax , be that it seem derivative . it be about a maverick doctor play by Clive Owen who be rude to almost everyone around him <unknown> like the abrasive hero of Hugh Laurie \'s Fox series , House . he work at a hospital in a big city , in the shadow of big hospital , fight for attention and respect <unknown> like the doctor on St. Elsewhere . the title the Knick , in fact , be short for Knickerbocker Hospital , and be as derisive a nickname as " St. Elsewhere " be for Boston \'s St. Eligius . but the Knick be set in New York , not Boston . and it be not a modern hospital at all , because this new drama series be set in downtown New York City at the start of the 20th century . and in that way , too , the Knick seem overly familiar , because a recent BBC America series , Copper , cover very similar terrain , in both date and place . but here come a pleasant surprise . Cinemax send out seven of the show \'s @card@ episode for preview , and the more I watch , the more persuade I become that the Knick be on a very original journey , and make the most of its increasingly singular cast of character . on the Knick , the graphic scene be riveting , say David <unknown> , though at time you may want to look away . here , Clive Owen \'s character administer a shot . i on the Knick , the graphic scene be riveting , say David <unknown> , though at time you may want to look away . here , Clive Owen \'s character administer a shot . Mary <unknown> of <unknown> at the center of all this period medicine and mayhem be Owen as Dr. John Thackery , a medical maverick and pioneer who have more regard for new technique than any bedside manner . when first we see him , he be shoot drug between his toe , like Mel Profitt on Wiseguy , and exhibit little patience with the staff <unknown> like Lucy , a new young nurse from the South play by Eve Hewson . even though the setting be a turn-of-the-century hospital ward , the verbal tension may as well come straight from Grey \'s anatomy . the conflict deepen episode by episode , along with the character . the head of surgery , play by Matt <unknown> from Max <unknown> and <unknown> Black , demonstrate early on a risky operation that will be try , time and again , in subsequent episode . each time , it become more dramatic and more meaningful . a new doctor at the hospital , play by Andre Holland , be just as gifted , brilliant and innovative as Dr. Thackery <unknown> but his skin be black , which make his circumstance , and his opportunity , completely different . and there be other key character at the Knick as well <unknown> from the heiress who help fund the hospital to the unscrupulous ambulance driver who help hunt for research cadaver and other moneymaking opportunity . the slowly blossom beauty of the Knick , as a TV series , be that it move in unexpected direction and at a thoughtfully deliberate pace . if you presume Dr. Thackery be go to bond with that young nurse , or the new doctor , right away , you will be wrong . and medical case , which at first appear to be singular event , turn out to be continue story line where we watch patient heal , or fail to . and doctor , too , keep try new procedure and new equipment in discover the path to an enlightened new age of medical science . One impressive aspect of the Knick be that it mix the late development in medicine <unknown> a makeshift suction device , a new X-ray machine <unknown> alongside more mainstream discovery , like the bicycle and electricity . Director Steven Soderbergh , who last work for HBO on the Emmy-winning behind the <unknown> , trust both his vision and his actor . the graphic operating-room scene be riveting , even as their primitive and bloody display of medical technique make you want to look away . and though it would n\'t be fair to sample a clip from one of the late episode , there be a point , midway through the Knick , when Clive Owen , in one single passionate scene , provide more than enough ammunition for a shot at next year \'s Emmy <unknown> . and Andre Holland , as Dr. Algernon Edwards , be right on his heel . get into the Knick <unknown> deeply into it , where it begin to prove itself beyond doubt <unknown> will take two or three episode . but once you check into this particular TV hospital , and stick around for a while , you will care about the character , their storey and their amazing new invention .

'er','" <unknown> " be arguably the well major health care-related television series since " <unknown> , " and it be one of the most medically realistic dramatic series ever . when " <unknown> " leave prime time after well over a decade on the air , it will also have be one of the most popular show in history . it will likely continue for year in syndication around the world . accordingly , it will continue to have a tremendous influence on how the global public view health care , include nursing . " <unknown> " have generally portray nurse as competent , caring health worker and avoid the most obvious stereotype . but the show \'s <unknown> approach have lead to a continue failure to give viewer an accurate or complete picture of the vital role nursing actually play in modern health care . throughout the show \'s run , only one of its eight to ten major character have be a nurse , with the rest physician or medical student . the few nurse who do emerge from the wallpaper tend to be skilled , but fungible . with rare exception , they serve as subordinate and romantic foil for the heroic physician , who consistently do key care task that nurse do in real life . since its inception in @card@ , " <unknown> " have focus on the professional development and personal life of a shift cast of emergency department ( editor ) and surgical physician , and the personal life of one editor nurse , at " County General , " the main public hospital in Chicago . key to the show \'s success have be its <unknown> depiction of emergency procedure , complete with whirl camera work and <unknown> technical dialogue , an addictive soap opera approach to the intersect life of the main character , and an amazing ability to regenerate itself with new <unknown> the start of the 12th season , none of the original major character remain . in addition , unlike some popular hospital dramas , " <unknown> " have grapple seriously with many of the thorny issue raise by modern health care . it have also feature some inventive plot , strong character , good direction and fine act . in recent year the show have slow down creatively , and some digression into the character \' non-work life have grow tiresome . but " <unknown> " be still capable of engaging work , and it remain very popular . synopsis ( series ) in its early year , " <unknown> " introduce the model that would prove so effective : dedicated , intelligent physician staggering under the volume and complexity of case see in a public Level One <unknown> Center , and try to cope with the effect on their professional and personal life . the show \'s plot be too intricate to summarize fully here , but major character in the early year include : John Carter ( Noah Wyle ) , a wide-eyed medical student from a wealthy family who would ultimately become chief editor resident , and who may end up as the most important character in the show \'s history ; Mark Greene ( Anthony Edwards ) , a sensitive , decent <unknown> chief resident whose marriage to an attorney ultimately fall apart and who become , as an attend , the show \'s moral center ; Kerry Weaver ( Laura Innes ) , an insensitive , physically disable <unknown> senior resident who consistently put herself before her colleague , and become chief of emergency medicine ; Carol Hathaway ( Julianna Margulies ) , whose suicide attempt be feature in the series premiere , a tough and committed <unknown> nurse who become a nurse manager ; Doug Ross ( George Clooney ) , a <unknown> pediatric editor resident whose maverick way would eventually lead to his departure from the hospital and the show , follow by long-time flame Hathaway ; Peter Benton ( <unknown> La Salle ) , a coldly intense surgical resident who seem to have a maximum allotment of one smile per season , which he do n\'t always use ; Jeanie Boulet ( Gloria Reuben ) , an earnest , HIV-positive physician \'s assistant ; Susan Lewis ( Sherry Stringfield ) , a down-to-earth editor resident who would leave the show for several season ; Elizabeth Corday ( Alex Kingston ) , a skilled English surgeon who would ultimately marry Greene ; and the great Robert Romano ( Paul Mccrane ) , an acid-tongued , highly skilled surgical attend who would become the chief of medicine and who serve , along with Weaver , as the show \'s enduring <unknown> . as the show get deep into its first decade , these character begin to leave and be replace , a process that have never stop . Ross and late Hathaway depart for the Northwest to raise their twin , and Benton leave for a job that would allow him to care for his young son . perhaps most significantly , Greene succumb to brain cancer , leave Corday to raise their young daughter alone . Corday return to County and stay for some time . but she eventually quit and return to England rather than accept a demotion for perform a noble but illegal organ donation between two HIV-positive people .

Weaver carry on raise their baby , and eventually have a hip replacement that allow her to walk unaided . the show anoint Carter , now <unknown> chief resident , to be Greene \'s successor as its moral and professional heart . in the middle year of the show , Carter thrive professionally , become an attend . but he do not do as well in his personal life , get close to a marriage proposal to newcomer Abby Lockhart ( right ) ( Maura Tierney ) before pull back , and make several soul-searching trip to provide care in war-torn Congo . Carter return from one of these with new girlfriend Kem . their baby be stillborn , and Kem flee , but Carter eventually realize his heart be no longer in Chicago . he leave to join Kem at the end of the 11th season , though he return in the 12th season for a few episode set in <unknown> ( Sudan ) . Lockhart become the show \'s most important character as Carter fade . at first , Lockhart be a somewhat confused , alcoholic <unknown> nurse who be attend medical school . then she settle in as the <unknown> major editor nurse character , and appear commit to nursing . then she reverse course again and go back to medical school . Lockhart stay in the editor as an intern and then a resident , eventually become involve with newcomer Luka Kovac ( Goran <unknown> ) . Kovac be a Croatian editor attend who replace Ross as the show \'s designate hunk , but who have difficulty overcome the death of his wife and child in the Balkans war . by the end of the 12th season , Lockhart and Kovac be expect a baby , Lockhart be an increasingly assertive resident , and Kovac have replace Lewis as chief of <unknown> medicine . the <unknown> major nurse character have be tough young single mother Sam Taggart ( Linda <unknown> ) . Taggart be highly skilled . but most of her early <unknown> focus on her romance with Kovac , and their joint effort to raise her son Alex in spite of the negative influence of his <unknown> violent criminal who ultimately escape from prison and kidnap Taggart and their son , before Taggart herself execute him with his own gun . Taggart become assistant nurse manager in the early 12th season episode with the highly skilled , aggressive <unknown> nurse manager Eve Peyton . but Taggart \'s new role seem to evaporate with Peyton \'s abrupt firing for deck an offensive patient on Christmas Eve . other new character arrive , and some stay . <unknown> Chen ( <unknown> ) , a contemporary of Carter \'s who have briefly appear on the show near the start , return as a resourceful but troubled senior resident . after a time she quit the editor to care for , and ultimately <unknown> , her fail father . Michael Gallant ( Sharif Atkins ) be a bright , decent medical student whose education be fund by his commitment to the U. S.

Gregory Pratt ( <unknown> Phifer ) , an often arrogant intern struggle to care for his mentally disabled brother , have a relationship with Chen . Pratt later show sign of mature , and he become far more skilled , but he refuse to pursue the chief resident job . Ray Barnett ( Shane West ) be a brash young resident who struggle to balance his day job with his passion for play in a rock band ; he become more commit to medicine , and be fire from his band . and in the 12th season , borderline incompetent resident Archie Morris ( Scott Grimes ) , who have be a minor character , become a major one . as the new chief resident , he generally remain an annoy , self-important weasel , though he also show sign of great skill and decency . since the beginning , the show have also feature a diverse group of recur minor nurse character . they have include <unknown> Marquez ( Laura Ceron ) , <unknown> Adams ( right ) ( Yvette Freeman ) , Lily Jarvik ( Lily <unknown> ) , Malik McGrath ( <unknown> D ) , Lydia Wright ( Ellen Crawford ) , Yoshi Takata ( <unknown> Watanabe ) , and Connie <unknown> ( Connie Marie Brazelton ) . these character have be well draw , though in contrast to the major character , we have learn little about their non-work life . they be often busy at the periphery of a clinical scene , and they have occasionally play notable role in specific <unknown> . for instance , in the 12th season premiere , Marquez and Adams be see play a key role in cope with " July syndrome , " which occur each year when new physician intern start work . portrayal of Nursing ( series ) " <unknown> " have generally depict nurse as competent , caring professional with technical training who contribute to patient outcome . unlike many show , it have resist portray them as Nurse <unknown> , sex object , or mute cipher who appear occasionally to execute physician command . it have show some nurse to be man and member of minority group , though all three of the major nurse character have be straight white female . it have even show nurse manager , though these depiction have be problematic . unfortunately , the show \'s limited effort to highlight the work of nurse have be overwhelm by the <unknown> vision that have dominate its first @card@ episode . this include the hopelessly lopsided nurse : physician major character ratio , the regular portrayal of physician do and get credit for exciting , important work that nurse do in real life , the frequent suggestion that nurse be physician subordinate , the intense focus on physician training while nurse \' professional development be virtually ignore , the disproportionate emphasis on the one major nurse character \'s personal life , and the mishandle of slur against nursing . the Carol Hathaway , Abby Lockhart , and Sam Taggart character be , along with " <unknown> \'s Margaret Houlihan and " China <unknown> \'s Colleen McMurphy , among the most influential portrayal of nurse in television history . the " <unknown> " nurse be capable , nuanced and generally positive . Hathaway in particular be a strong character , and a nurse manager who at a few point actually confront some real-life nursing issue . although Lockhart be fairly weak early on , in late season she begin to show sign of an actual nursing identity , explain why she choose to remain a nurse rather than continue with medical school , teach resident Gallant the rope , and question some physician treatment decision . unfortunately , Lockhart appear to grow frustrated with nursing and abruptly reverse course , return to medical school . that suggest , wrongly , that nurse who pursue graduate education typically do so in medicine rather than nursing . current major nurse character Taggart be a strong character with obvious skill and a willingness to advocate for patient , though at first her toughness arguably veer into inappropriate aggression . early in the 12th season , Eve Peyton make Taggart assistant nurse manager , but there have be no real mention of this since Peyton \'s departure . the recur minor nurse character likewise have be show as care professional with skill . over the year , a few episode of the show have make some effort to highlight nursing skill or concern . the Hathaway era include a <unknown> about a nursing labor dispute , and one episode in which Hathaway ( right ) have to provide solo care to a critical patient in a dangerous hostage situation . indeed , as a nurse manager , Hathaway confront nurse administration over the float of nurse away from editor , she start an <unknown> clinic and hire a nurse practitioner to work there ( that do not last long ) , and she even quit briefly over the effect of insurance on the editor \'s practice . at one point , Lockhart give a brief but spirited defense of her nursing ability , and at time she also engage the physician in meaningful care discussion ( though her return to medical school suggest that this may have be part of her outgrow nursing ) . Taggart \'s <unknown> have include one where she provide significant autonomous care to a critically injure rape victim , albeit with disastrous result , and another where she actually make an important catch that an intern have <unknown> receive credit for it . in its 12th season , the show present the formidable , <unknown> <unknown> nurse manager Eve Peyton ( right ) . she be not a major character , and she appear in only six episode . but it be an unprecedented portrait of a mostly autonomous nursing leader who be more or less the clinical peer of the attend physician . indeed , Peyton may have be the most clinically expert nurse character ever to appear on a major prime time U. S. show . she take the nursing staff firmly in hand , dole out advice , hold staff meeting , and tell senior physician how they be screw up . the show stress her autonomy and professionalism . she push for systemic change in everything from order new supply for cut edge procedure to encourage more hand washing . she brush back physician on her autonomy over the nursing <unknown> even embarrass them with superior clinical knowledge . after recruit Taggart as assistant nurse manager , she briefly seem to become something of a mentor to the young nurse . however , these isolated <unknown> have be swallow by the hundred of hour " <unknown> " have spend tell viewer around the world that only physician care matter much . for all its medical realism , the show remain a victim of what Kalisch and Kalisch have call " Marcus Welby syndrome " : the inaccurate depiction of all significant health care be provide by physician . the show have frequently show physician perform critical nursing task , such as triage , patient teaching , give medication , provide <unknown> support , minute-to-minute care of the critically ill , and preventative care such as vaccination . nurse be not the only one affect by this ; the show commonly have physician do the job of social worker and respiratory therapist as well . the show \'s physician nursing be a natural result of its consistent practice of have only one of the eight to ten major character be a nurse , when in a real life Level One <unknown> Center the <unknown> ratio would likely be about @card@ . the show \'s character ratio would make it difficult to portray the two profession \' role accurately even if the show want to . of course , the show do have some recur minor nurse character . but they have be use mostly to deliver brief patient status update to physician ( " BP be @card@ over @card@ ! " ) , to absorb physician command , and to act as dramatic foil for the main character . these nurse rarely have substantial interaction with patient , and be almost never see provide care without a physician . To our knowledge , they have not play a major overall role in any episode . moreover , the show have consistently portray nurse as subordinate to the physician who dominate it , rather than as member of an autonomous <unknown> exemplify by its frequent depiction of physician manage , discipline , and even fire nurse . it be true that Hathaway actually act as a nurse manager at time in the early year , though she be at time present as be under the authority of the <unknown> <unknown> . Lockhart too be dub a " nurse manager , " though she be force into it and do next to nothing with the title . now , it be Taggart \'s turn to ostensibly be " assistant nurse manager , " but since Peyton \'s departure , Taggart have do no " managing , " and it be not clear if there have even be a " nurse manager . " not surprisingly , the show have fill this nursing management void with physician . it frequently tell viewer that physician direct all care and essentially manage nurse , even if they may have hire some unseen nurse administrator to handle the paperwork . some might expect good from a show that be create by a physician , and that have count physician as some of its key writer . of course , there be the six Eve Peyton episode in the 12th season . these make crystal clear that Peyton , as <unknown> nurse manager , do not report to <unknown> physician . but for a show that air more than @card@ original episode each year , they be obviously a drop in the bucket . moreover , the episode \' depiction of nursing autonomy be itself problematic . it suggest that Peyton report to chief of medicine Kerry Weaver . and although we be not too concern at first that Peyton be see as a <unknown> " <unknown> show have have its share of physician manager in that <unknown> \'s final episode be a crude and implausible swerve into extreme battleaxe territory . in that episode , Peyton get dump by her boyfriend ; deck an offensive patient dress as Santa Claus and pour his own urine on him , with no physical provocation and no regret ; be fire in a matter of hour ; and bid farewell to the <unknown> staff with standard <unknown> phrase like " bite me , " " screw <unknown> , " and " you all suck . " Peyton be at least fire by a " nursing supervisor " rather than a physician . but the episode spoil even that nod at nurse autonomy by have <unknown> medical chief Kovac send three of Peyton \'s nurse home because he foresee a light shift , and call them " support staff " as he do so , with no contradiction . the show have also give viewer little sense of the independent , science-based assessment and intervention that be central to the nursing process . in recent season it have occasionally depict nurse in their patient advocacy role , which can entail question physician \' care plan and catch their mistake . but this have almost always be when the physician be somehow impair , as by illness or inexperience ; otherwise , the nurse tend to lose out in such discussion . " <unknown> " have not often show a nurse act as a primary force in a patient \'s outcome . instead , with rare exception , physician tend to receive all the credit or blame for the result . apart from the Peyton episode , the show have pay virtually no attention to the professional development of nurse , such as through advanced nursing degree , research or scholarship . nurse character have limit opportunity to display their special knowledge and skill , especially since nursing student be never show . this stand in stark contrast to the show \'s obsessive focus on each stage and feature of the physician \' professional development , from medical student through the chief of medicine . tellingly , Lockhart finally choose a medical career and Hathaway flirt with one , as if to prove that they be worthy of the show \'s attention despite " only " being nurse . all three major nurse character have also spend much of their time in romance with the show \'s physician , and in a number of episode , a key role of the minor nurse character have be to comment idly on the life of the physician . the show have also develop a pattern of mishandle slur against nursing . typically , it will have a character who be socially <unknown> an abrasive attend like Romano or Weaver , an unhappy patient , or a visit <unknown> contempt for nursing . perhaps the character will suggest that nursing be all about bedpan , or call a female physician a nurse as an insult , or suggest that nurse do n\'t know anything about the prognosis of a major stroke victim , or express fear at the thought of be a nurse but joy at the prospect of be a physician . in response , a nurse character will look hurt , but she will not say anything . or the remark will be make outside of any nurse \'s earshot , and no one will question it . the show may think it be help viewer see how hard it be to be a nurse . but the persistent failure to have any character rebut such slur will likely lead many viewer to conclude that while the speaker may be mean , what he or she say be essentially correct . it be just not the kind of thing nice people actually say . there be one notable slur reversal . at one point , Peyton fail to get Kovac to come help a resident with a critical patient . so Peyton do the require cutting-edge procedure herself , teach the resident as she go , then advise the late-arrive Kovac that if he need her , she will be off change a bedpan . finally , though the show pride itself on be on the cut edge of social issue and have refer to the budget crisis in public hospital , it have still pay no serious attention to the current nursing shortage or the <unknown> that drive it . this be a shortage that have for some year be a major threat to global health , but that " <unknown> be generally inadequate portrayal of nursing have do little to address . the Abby Lockhart character do suggest in pass in @card@ that low nurse staffing would likely cause patient death -- in the context of an episode in which chief of <unknown> medicine Romano have unilaterally fire a number of nurse . and one of the @card@ Eve Peyton episode include a fleeting reference to the hospital \'s agreement to implement <unknown> nurse staffing ratio . but that seem to be a quick way to set up new assistant nurse manager Taggart , whose first big task be to fire <unknown> Adams for work excessive overtime . that plot also wrongly suggest that the big problem now be some nurse seek to work too many extra shift , rather than the reverse problem of <unknown> , in which hospital force nurse to work excessive hour in order to cut cost . the real problem of short staffing have never be explore . over its @card@ season , " <unknown> " have show some real appreciation for the role nurse play in modern emergency care . however , that recognition almost invariably give way to its obsessive focus on the training and practice of physician . in real life , nurse , physician and other health professional have complementary and interdependent work relationship . but on " <unknown> , " the bottom line have usually be that the physician \' role be unrealistically large and robust , and the nurse \' role correspondingly small and flat . in dramatic term , the physician be the tragic hero , while the nurse be essentially member of the chorus . read more : <unknown> : <unknown> . <unknown> . <unknown> . <unknown> ',medical
