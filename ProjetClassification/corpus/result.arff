'the_legend_of_korra','It\'s been 70 years since Aang saved his home world from the dastardly machinations of the Fire Lord and, wow, have things changed.No longer is this Nickelodeon playland the mystical, medieval place it was in Aang\'s time, pulling cultural and spiritual threads from ancient Asian and Inuit civilizations. It\'s gone modern now, resembling a fanciful 1920s-era civilization in which motorcars and grainy movies coexist alongside the world\'s ever-present magic.But it\'s not exactly a peaceful coexistence.At the time of this review update, The Legend of Korra has romped through all four of its planned seasons (or books), each of which encountered its own unique conflicts. At the center of each: the headstrong Korra, the newest incarnation of the Avatar. While there are lots of folks born with the ability to manipulate and weaponize ("bend") the world\'s core elements (earth, air, fire, water and spirit), only the Avatar has the ability to bend them all. It\'s a big responsibility, and she hasn\'t always felt up to the task. For a while, in fact, it seemed like she completely abdicated her preordained role, vanishing for years. But she\'s always returned to save the day, be it putting down a group of anti-bending forces called the Equalists in "Book One: Air," or quashing a militaristic dictatorship from the Earth Kingdom in "Book Four: Balance," Korra\'s always come through—even though the cost has been high at times. The Legend of Korra feels exactly and nothing at all like its popular predecessor, Aang\'s Avatar: The Last Airbender. While the sense of storytelling is similar (its anime style and humor, for instance), the actual story is quite different. The characters are older, for one thing. Korra\'s an older teen for most of the series and well on her way to commanding her powers; the free-spirited Aang was 12. Instead of presenting a rollicking, travel-based adventure story, Korra creeps up on an urban cloak-and-dagger thriller. The language is nearly always pristine. The violence is E10+ video game level, about the same as you\'d find in a typical rerun of an old G.I. Joe cartoon. Our heroes are courageous and, often, self-sacrificial, and even though they sometimes rebel against authority, they often come to learn that their elders have lots more wisdom to offer than they might\'ve originally thought. Given Nickelodeon\'s penchant for undercutting parental authority and delivering inappropriate laughs in its live-action comedies, this animated adventure reads as one of the channel\'s cleaner shows.But there are other morality- and spirituality-bending concerns.First, a reaction to attraction. While these teens sometimes batted their eyes at one another, relationships remained relatively chaste throughout most of the series. But in literally the very last minute of the very last episode, Korra and her long-standing female friend Asami walk into a "spirit portal" holding hands, then turn to face each other, smiling. It\'s a pretty innocent scene. Or so it might seem to some. Writes The Daily Beast\'s Melissa Leon, "There was no kiss, which (I guess) could have allowed viewers to interpret the hand-holding as platonic, but … the show\'s writers, Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, made it explicit: Korra and Asami are bisexual." Here\'s what DiMartino and Konietzko said: "[We wanted to] make it as clear as possible that, yes, Korra and Asami have romantic feelings for each other." DiMartino wrote on his website, "The moment where they enter the spirit portal symbolizes their evolution from being friends to being a couple."On the spiritual side of things, Korra assumes that most viewers are already familiar with Avatar\'s ethereal essence (as it dove deeply into Aang\'s reincarnation and his exploration of supernatural powers while fleshing out Eastern religious themes, introducing spirits and demigods, etc.). Which means it spends a little less time dealing with such otherworldly underpinnings. But that\'s not to say the underworld\'s all been blown off the map as if by an airbender. It\'s just been transplanted into a more steampunk scenario.Episode ReviewsDecember 19, 2014TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tvpg"The Last Stand" It\'s the climactic showdown between "Team Avatar" and Earth Kingdom dictator Kuvira, who mans a gigantic doomsday machine. Handsome firebender Mako and his younger brother Bolin battle engineers and take down the robot\'s engine, with Mako risking his life to do so. (The two drag the engineers to safety before the engine room explodes.) Korra battles Kuvira, who means to kill her if it\'s the last thing she does. But when Kuvira\'s plans go haywire, Korra puts her life on the line to save her longtime foe.Korra and Asami hold hands and give each other a "meaningful" look as they travel to the spirit world for a vacation. (It\'s a gesture the show\'s writers say hints at lesbian attraction.) Violence and war is everywhere, though no one seems to die. People flee from nuclear-like explosions. They dodge fire, earth and loads of metal blades, sometimes crashing into things painfully. The robot tears its own arm off and throws it. Then a massive gun triggers a "natural spirit portal," and creatures called "spirits" come out of it to frolic in the suddenly park-like setting.May 19, 2012TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tvy7"The Aftermath" After an Equalist attack takes out Republic City\'s arena, Korra and her pals discover that carmaker Hiroshi Sato—father of Asami, Mako\'s girlfriend—is in league with Amon. Asami did not know of her father\'s apparently evil designs, and when Sato asks her to join him and turn her back on her friends, she zaps him with one of his own power-draining gloves … but not before she says, "I love you, Dad." Korra and her allies take on a phalanx of platinum cyborgs, using their magical abilities to fight clinking, clanking foes. (Several people are knocked out during the skirmish.) Mako and Bolin trick, knock down and then tie up a guard.After failing to uncover Sato\'s plot early enough, the head of city security decides to resign her post and fight the Equalists "outside the law." Korra eavesdrops on Sato. Asami invites Mako and Bolin to live at her father\'s mansion without first asking. "It\'s easier to ask forgiveness than permission," she says. Korra apologizes to Asami for thinking she was "prissy."',animation
'teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles','If only every show was named in such a straightforward manner as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo and Raphael—the main characters in Nickelodeon\'s new computer-animated rendering of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles—are indeed turtles. They\'re teenagers (though what that means in turtle years, I\'m not really sure). They\'re mutants (after they wallowed around in a powerful, otherworldly substance called, helpfully, mutagen). And thanks to their adoptive father, the rat-mutant Splinter, they know how to ninja something fierce. The turtles live in the sewer underneath New York City, but it\'s not nearly as bad as it sounds. Their pad is nice and clean, outfitted with everything that active, pizza-loving, human-hybrid reptiles could want. The only problem, really, is the neighborhood. Bad guys love to hang around the sewers too. The Kraang, a collective of brainish-like beings inhabiting cookie-cutter robots, keep bothering the turtles. And Splinter\'s old archenemy The Shredder shows up to make life even more challenging.But these turtles are up for a fight or 2,000. If it wasn\'t for these visiting enemies, they\'d simply eat pizza and play video games all day, and then someone would have to rename the show Teenage Mutant Lazy Turtles. Which, of course, no one would watch. Who wants to watch ninja turtles not get down and ninja?So ninja they get. They fight like crazy, and the detailed animation gives the battles more violent depth and pop than the old 1980s cartoon could ever muster. No one is killed, but characters get hit and kicked and knocked out, and loads of robots lose their hands and arms and feet and heads (sending their inhabiting brains scurrying for safety). Aside from that cartoony violence, there\'s little else to talk about here. The turtles fight off the bad guys, saving NYC from a fate worse than slime and sewage. While Splinter has a vague air of Eastern spirituality about him, we\'ve not seen him discuss religion. His lessons appear to be more along the lines of general platitudes: Friendship is awesome, compassion is cool, defend what\'s right, that sort of thing. Foul language lives on the level of "darn" and "heck." Sexuality? Not in this TV-Y7 romp. And while there is a bit of crude humor now and then (they do live in a sewer, after all), it could be far, far, worse.Nick\'s new show is more violently slapstick than its 1980s and \'90s predecessor. But it still boasts much of the same hip-silly mutant DNA. And that\'s certainly not the worst thing that could fight its way into your family room today.Episode ReviewsDecember 15, 2012TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tvy7"It Came From the Depths" Leatherhead, a mutant alligator, makes his Nick debut with a bang. And a crunch. And a smash. He dismantles a score of Kraang robots, ripping off their heads and arms, and throwing them into walls. (The brains all get away safely, but the robots themselves are a complete loss.) He also roughs up the ninja turtles, grabbing one by the head and fighting with the rest. Michelangelo and Splinter suggest that Leatherhead is just misunderstood, and then they learn that he was cruelly abused by the Kraang. So the turtles soak up a valuable message about not judging someone too hastily and/or by how he looks.Not that that keeps Splinter and Leatherhead from fighting. And one scene, in which decapitated robotic heads come alive again and robotic hands crawl on the floor, seems almost an homage to the horror flick convention. The turtles watch a sci-fi show wherein a "compassionate" captain solves a shipwide infestation of cute-but-annoying creatures by throwing them all in an airlock and jettisoning them into space. Michelangelo spits a pizza-milkshake concoction back into the blender. We hear "heck" and "darn" a time or two each.',animation
'american_dad','Seth MacFarlane is the creator of a bevy of envelope-pushing animated programs, including Family Guy, The Cleveland Show … and this fierce farce. American Dad pushes that envelope so hard, in fact, that the Parents Television Council recently asked its members to complain to the Federal Communications Commission, hoping to get the series sanctioned or fined. "This past summer the United States Supreme Court unanimously upheld the congressionally mandated authority of the Federal Communications Commission to enforce the broadcast decency law, which prohibits the airing of indecent material on the publicly-owned airwaves during times when children are likely to be in the audience," PTC president Tim Winter said in a statement. "In the past, American Dad and MacFarlane\'s other programs have included scenes mocking people with Down syndrome, implying father-daughter incest, a man masturbating a horse, a baby eating horse sperm, and a character eating vomit and excrement out of a baby\'s diaper. Some of those broadcasts are under review at the FCC for violating the broadcast decency law."Several years ago, Newsweek called Family Guy "a traditional domestic sitcom soaked in battery acid." The same could be said of American Dad. A virtual clone of its predecessor, Dad follows the Smith family, led by kooky CIA agent Stan and his levelheaded wife, Francine. Sharing their house are two teenagers (daughter Hayley is now married), a talking goldfish and an effeminate, disguise-wearing alien.This satirical series operates on a single guiding principle: Nothing is off-limits, from necrophilia to cocaine and from mindless murder to eating excrement. The family goldfish constantly hits on Francine (an obsession birthed after it glimpses her without underwear). Hayley becomes a stripper at one point, and to show their unconditional support and love as "good" parents, Stan and Francine sit in the front row during one of her routines, cheering, making crude comments and tossing money. Stan sits naked in a hot tub with two gay neighbors. Etcetera. Ad nauseam.In the meantime, a blitz of tasteless material targets God, Christians, Muslims, blacks, the homeless and handicapped people. MacFarlane admits, "It\'s not the most cutting-edge comedy in the world, but there\'s just a flavor to that stuff that I think is just so wonderful. … In the design style and music, it\'s very traditional, but we layer the outrageous comedy on top of that. What you get is the best of all worlds."Exactly how American Dad can be considered the best of anything is as incomprehensible as an alien family member and a lustful goldfish.Episode ReviewsOctober 7, 2012TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tv14"Killer Vacation" On vacation, Stan accidentally kills three dolphins instead of the human outdoor activity director he was going for. A suicidal lemur provocatively sucks on the gun barrel before someone spears the guy in the back, splashing Stan and Francine with blood. Someone gets beaten with a tennis racquet.Hayley and Jeff, meanwhile, try to rekindle their sex life, talking crudely about their lack of intimacy. They try role-playing (naked under the covers with costume headgear on). And Jeff talks about tricking Hayley with mayonnaise (as a stand-in for semen). There are verbal and visual gags about dolphin menstruation, sexual choking games, married swingers, incest, homosexual sex, ejaculation, cross-dressing and a boy damaging his penis. There are several rather elongated "adventures" by family members on a nude beach. Stan\'s boss ogles pictures of Francine and asks Stan to send more shots of her breasts.We hear "b‑‑ch," "h‑‑‑," "bloody" and about 10 misuses of God\'s name. One obscenity is bleeped. Some of the jokes are based on racial inferences. We hear people talk about urination, feces and the biological intricacies of a colostomy bag. ',animation
'avatar_the_last_airbender','It\'s not difficult to see the appeal of Nickelodeon\'s Avatar: The Last Airbender, now entering its third season as TV\'s top animated series among boys ages 9-14. This Lord of the Rings-style journey of a group of likeable youngsters offers viewers a rich history, plenty of plotlines and characters, and a vast Asian-influenced fantasy world. At the center is Aang, an all-powerful, reincarnated spirit being that, each generation, inhabits a human body to bring about worldwide harmony. But establishing peace is no easy task. The power-hungry Fire Nation is set to rule the globe after a 100-year war, and with all other people groups nearly decimated, Aang is humanity\'s last hope. He\'s supposedly the only one skilled in manipulating all of nature\'s basic elements. But he isn\'t. A rival shares his powers. Furthermore, instead of having years of schooling to hone the art of "waterbending" and the like (generating wave whips, fireballs, earthquakes), Aang must learn on the job. Can he and his friends overthrow the Fire Lord and his malicious brood before summer ends?Though made in the States, Avatar is a melting pot of Eastern spirituality that\'s disturbingly bold for a tween-oriented cartoon. Besides reincarnation, the Avatar represents the "spirit of the earth" and harnesses a force that one ghostly forefather calls "a combination of all your past lives focusing their energy through your body." Aang regularly stumbles into the spirit world (he\'s even given drugs to induce this state), and can leave his body to travel an astral plane. Characters also refer to their qi when mustering supernatural power. Locations are described as hubs of spiritual energy. Gurus read that energy and receive visions through meditation, while others possess healing prowess.Dubious spirituality notwithstanding, our "heroes" regularly disrespect elders and are celebrated for breaking rules. After being taunted, two of Aang\'s friends retaliate by sending bullies down a raging river. And that barely scratches the surface of the show\'s violence. The saga alludes to tribal genocide and general warfare while Avatar\'s martial arts and Matrix-style fighting involve bodies getting tossed around amid dynamite explosions, moving rock formations and fiery blasts. Hardly kids\' stuff.As an art form, anime has a proclivity toward violence and teen rebellion. That\'s disconcerting but par for the course. More disturbing is Avatar\'s mendacious spiritualism—explained, demonstrated and attractively packaged for young viewers.',animation
'the_adventures_of_puss_in_boots','The Adventures of Puss in BootsMost cats are less pets and more freeloading houseguests. They eat when they want, sleep when they want and destroy whatever houseplant displeases them. They\'re liable to leave home for days at a time, only to slink back for a little Meow Mix, pretending that they never left. Cats are pretty independent, is what I\'m saying. Which makes Puss in Boots\' attachment to the town of San Lorenzo a tad unusual.On the surface, Puss seems like he should be about as independent a kitty as you\'re likely to find. Those famous boots of his are made for walking, see, and for most of his nine lives, the cat has dodged in and out of danger with nary a second thought. Sure, he has his friends, but there\'s no question Puss is a feline who likes his "me" time. He proved an invaluable helpmate to Shrek in a series of movies dedicated to that great green guy, then wandered off to make one of his own. He\'s used to pouncing from adventure to adventure, pausing just long enough to lap up a little victory milk, collect any nearby loot and cause certain coquettish kitties to swoon.But when he stumbled into the quaint, quirky and exceedingly wealthy village of Netflix—er, San Lorenzo, Mr. Boots found a real home and an odd, loving family. It was the beautiful and naive Dulcinea who was the original draw for the swashbuckling cat, but there\'s clearly more to it than that. He\'s grown fond of the town\'s swarm of gregarious orphans and collection of eccentric adults. And he finds that he enjoys being needed protecting San Lorenzo and its treasures from rampaging thieves (which makes him perhaps the world\'s only legitimate guard cat).And, like any cat worth its sandpaper tongue, he stays pretty clean while doing so.This is not to say that The Adventures of Puss in Boots purrs along without any problems at all. We are talking about Puss in Boots, after all—an animal with all the martial bravado and derring-do of a baker\'s dozen of musketeers. It\'s a rare episode that does not include a rollicking swordfight or a fulsome helping of fisticuffs. Sometimes these fights can cause animated injury or embarrassment. (In the show\'s title sequence, Boots has just cut the clothes off his adversaries, leaving them in their undies or covering their privates.) Magic is part of the mix, too. We\'re told that San Lorenzo was founded by a powerful mage (his talking statue still lurks in the treasury), and its vaults are filled with magical items. Some fantastical creatures may trek (or flamboyantly fly) into town occasionally. And when they don\'t, Puss sometimes ventures out to find them first. And, of course, our titular tabby will sometimes cast a smoldering glance in Dulcinea\'s direction.But Puss in Boots\' amorous intentions are far more subdued than those of, say, Pepé Le Pew, and so far the sordid shenanigans that showed up in Shrek are nowhere to be found here. DreamWorks and production partner Netflix seem determined to make something that\'s truly kid- and family-friendly.That may come as a bit of a surprise, especially given Netflix\' less-than-squeaky-clean reputation. (The outlet\'s most popular original programming has heretofore been saturated in caustic content found in such gritty and gratuitous series as House of Cards, Orange Is the New Black and Marco Polo.) But maybe Netflix aspires to a bigger entertainment tent than that and is now trying to plant a peg or two in cleaner dirt.It doesn\'t take much time for Dulcinea to realize that Puss in Boots has his share of flaws. He\'s conceited, selfish, petty, prideful ... and the list goes on. But she insists that our titular feline has a good heart. The same could be said for his show, and that makes the town of San Lorenzo a curiously nice place to visit. Episode ReviewsJanuary 16, 2015TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tvy7"Hidden" The first of five episodes released all at once on Netflix, "Hidden" introduces us to the secret town of San Lorenzo, a village founded by a magician to house orphans and magical treasure. But when Puss steals a coin from the treasury and dispels the town\'s cloaking magic, he plans a quick getaway.Dulcinea, Puss\' main lady, is a sweet, naive soul who has modeled her life on a Compendium of Facts and Funne, a book she totes around and quotes from as if it were the Bible. "When a mess you\'ve made at night, it\'s your job to set it right!" she tells Puss. At first Puss is unmoved, telling her such advice is for children who wet the bed. "I need no one!" he says. "But maybe someone needs you!" Dulcinea answers. And so Puss stays and begins his guard cat duties. Puss is smitten with Dulcinea, and the two touch hands. But mostly he engages in cartoonish brawls and swordfights. He threatens a horde of bandits with death. In the opening, we hear that he\'s an "adventurer, outlaw, lover" (as he sweeps a giggling maiden to safety), and he disrobes opponents with his sword, leaving them to cower in their skivvies. A human orphan admits to having a crush on an anthropomorphic pig. The language gets no more crushing than "gosh." A child picks her nose.',animation

'the_fairly_oddparents','Rule 1: Fairy godparents only grant wishes to kids.Rule 2: Fairy godparents can’t be seen by anyone but the kid they watch over.Rules three and four of Nickelodeon’s hottest new cartoon, The Fairly OddParents, specify that children aren’t allowed to blab about their fairies, and said fairies can’t mess with true love (like that matters to an 8-year-old).I’ll add one more: OddParents grants pleasure to children, not older teens or adults. But it’s reaching a lot of tweens. The fact that its audience tops out at age 12 makes it all the more amazing that the animated series consistently captures at least five of the Top-40 slots on cable each week.Maybe The Fairly OddParents is so popular because Timmy Turner wished it to be so. After all, he’s used to wishing for the impossible, having discovered he possesses his own personal set of fairy godparents who grant him nearly every desire that pops into his little head. Thankfully, not every fulfilled wish yields frivolous fun. When Timmy asks to be an adult his ensuing misadventures teach him not to wish for things he doesn’t understand. He quickly discovers he isn’t ready to handle grown-up responsibilities.Each half-hour show (divided into two segments) is full of cartoonish rowdiness. A dog tears off a boy’s underpants. An evil dentist rips a singer’s teeth out. A teacher gets hit by a car. A boy battles a coyote. A cop is slapped to the ground with a giant spatula. Timmy smacks a dog in the face with a baseball. You get the idea.As for crudities, after Timmy and his parents are transformed into battling superheroes, his mom—who uses her superpowers to morph into a shark—bites Timmy’s backside. For a moment or two, viewers are left staring at his bare bottom. After swapping brains with a dog, Timmy slurps water from a toilet at school. (Thinking he’s tough, a few of his peers follow suit.) And during a trip to the Middle Ages, Timmy witnesses a crowd of people preparing to eat a knight’s severed arm.True to television tradition, Timmy’s real dad and his OddDad are both lovable bumblers, and it’s his mom and OddMom who hold things together. But a consistent story thread communicates Timmy’s need for quantity time with both of his folks (more a message for eavesdropping parents than tuned-in kids). Timmy also learns the value of helping others, doing well at school, living sacrificially and taking care of his teeth. After all, who wants to visit an evil dentist?',animation
'star_wars','On May 25, 1977, George Lucas changed the cinematic world forever with a little movie that reconfigured our cultural understanding of the word blockbuster. Since then, Star Wars has been eclipsed at the domestic box office by only a handful of other movies … and I seriously doubt they\'ll be making cartoons about Avatar nearly 40 years from now. Which brings us to Star Wars: The Clone Wars, a CGI-animated show birthed by Cartoon Network with an auspicious theatrical premiere in 2008. Now the entire 13-episode sixth and final season arrives on Netflix (on March 7, 2014). Star Wars cognoscenti, of course, won\'t need a history lesson to explain where the titular Clone Wars fit into the franchise\'s timeline. For everyone else, a bit of backstory is in order: The series chronicles the heroic exploits of Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi and (for much of its run) feisty Padawan Ahsoka Tano during the three-year span between the live-action films Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. The Jedi warriors fight on behalf of the Galactic Republic against the rogue droid armies of the Confederacy of Independent Systems—more commonly known as the Separatists—led by Jedi-gone-bad Count Dooku and the cyborg menace General Grievous. Together, their adventures span the galaxy, from Felucia to Coruscant, from Christophsis to Mandalore. (There are also a few, often lighter episodes that don\'t feature the future Darth Vader.)The script blends equal parts intrigue and battle as the Jedi and their allies seek to outflank cunning enemies—be it in space, on the ground or anywhere in between. Missions include getting supplies to a blockaded ally, helping indigenous peoples ward off interlopers or trying to defuse an assassination plot, among many other things. A Yoda-like object lesson flashes on the screen for emphasis at the outset of each episode. "Searching for the truth is easy. Accepting the truth is hard," reads one. "In war, truth is the first casualty," reads another. And occasional deeper subtexts ask questions about the nature of good and evil or lightly poke situational ethics. So while some episodes are pretty light or even silly, others can be grim, dark and—in its own cartoon world—pretty violent. Clones and Jedi alike are killed on the field of battle. And as the series has drawn to a close, it\'s hard to forget that most of the Jedi we see are hurrying toward their own inevitable doom.As for the mystical energy field known as the Force, my words from The Clone Wars movie review are still relevant when it comes to the series as a whole: "Clone Wars assumes that viewers are already fully in the know regarding the pseudo-spiritual energy field that the Jedi harness for good and the Sith (dark Jedi) for ill. There are no long, expository conversations about the nature of the Force like the ones that pop up occasionally throughout the live-action films. Mostly, we see how it equips Anakin, Obi-Wan and Ahsoka … with superhuman agility in combat." The twist is that many young (some very young) fans of The Clone Wars animated series may have never seen the movies that define such spiritual subtleties. So beyond the cartoon violence, that\'s a fact parents would do well to grapple with before granting carte blanche permission to travel to a certain galaxy far, far away. Episode ReviewsMarch 7, 2014TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tvpg"The Unknown" A clone named Tup seems to lose it during a critical battle with the Separatists, assassinating a Jedi master during the skirmish with a shot to the head. (We see the dead Jedi, but not the actual death blow.) He mumbles, over and over, "Good soldiers follow orders" and tries to attack another Jedi, mystifying Anakin and Tup\'s clone colleagues. They speculate that Tup fell victim to some form of biological warfare but decide the only way to know for sure is to send a still-delirious Tup back to the planet Kamino to be examined. Getting him there proves difficult. The Separatists launch an attack on the Kamino-bound craft and kill everyone aboard. One victim gets yanked into the vacuum of space. Others are shot. When Anakin investigates the wreckage, a dead clone floats in space, his wide, vacant eyes staring blankly into the darkness. Droids get "killed," too. One is stabbed through the chest from behind. Another has an arm sliced away from the torso. Others have heads blown off. Clones are shot and killed elsewhere in shootouts reminiscent of the movies. December 8, 2012TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tvpg"A Sunny Day in the Void" Under the command of the diminutive Colonel Meebur Gascon, a ship bearing five droids (including R2-D2) is bashed and battered by a shower of comets. It crashes on a virtually featureless planet, forcing its occupants to figure out a way home.This episode is light and nearly combat free, but the themes are deeper than you might expect. The colonel and the computerized pilot, WAC-47, argue about the difference between the his "training" and WAC\'s "programming," with the alien\'s organic abilities often falling short of his more reliable computerized underlings. When the colonel implores to the sky above to "Show me a sign, deliver us hope," WAC admits to the other units, "I do not know who he is talking to. Maybe whoever programmed him."The colonel eventually sinks into philosophical self-pity. "Life is a void," he says. "We search and search for answers, but there are none. Hope is just an illusion. Death is the only certainty." WAC bucks him up, saying, "Giving up is not in my programming. I\'m surprised that it\'s in yours, Colonel." (The colonel does cheer up, and they\'re eventually saved by ostrich-like creatures, following neither God nor computer programming, but the animals\' instincts.) A couple of jokes are made about suicide. The crew finds a skeleton of both a creature and a robot. The colonel talks about rupturing his gizzard. Droids are called "stupid."April 2, 2010TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tvpg"Bounty Hunters" After getting shot down by Separatist forces, Obi-Wan, Anakin and Ahsoka find themselves stranded on the planet Felucia. Seeking a ride off the world, they stumble into a conflict between peace-loving farmers and a group of pirates who demand a share of their crops. The farmers have already contracted with bounty hunters for protection, but the Jedi\'s aid enables them to stand up to the pirates. This episode\'s stated lesson: "Courage makes heroes, but trust builds friendship." The underlying message here is that the best way to deal with bullies is to stand up to them. Most of the battle scenes involve living, breathing combatants on both sides (as opposed to droids). One of the bounty hunters chokes a pirate to death and drops his lifeless body on the ground. Another pirate takes a spear to the chest. Laser- and cannon-fire blow up buildings and hovering speeders, resulting in further casualties on both sides. March 26, 2010TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tvpg"Cat and Mouse" Anakin and Obi-Wan have been tasked with getting much-needed supplies to Senator Bail Organa on the besieged world of Christophsis. There\'s only one problem: It\'s being pummeled and blockaded by an impressive orbiting armada commanded by the spider-like General Trench. Combat in this episode primarily consists of ships trading fire in space, with many resulting explosions and presumed casualties. A couple of brief scenes show General Trench\'s bombers devastating a city. (Mostly we see explosions there, too). As is often the case in their relationship, Anakin has unilaterally decided that Obi-Wan\'s orders are not the best way to proceed. When he\'s labeled "reckless," Anakin responds, "Reckless … gets results." Likewise, When Obi-Wan says, "Might I remind you that this is not your mission," Anakin quips sarcastically, "You might."

'dragon_ball_z','Dragon Ball Z has replaced Pokémon as the cartoon fad of choice for American kids. But it isn’t a new craze. Akira Toriyama began drawing the Dragon Ball manga (Japanese for "comics") nearly two decades ago. It was quickly turned into anime (a cartoon) for Japanese television in 1986. Nine years later it was dubbed into English and exported to the U.S.Meandering story lines are byzantine in the extreme. Goku, Gohan, Piccolo, Vegeta and Trunks are but a few of the players woven into nearly infinite realities. Raised by a renowned martial artist, series hero Goku (a Saiyan boy with a tail) sets out on a quest for the seven dragon balls, which can summon a wish-granting dragon. After the dragon is mustered and a petition brought, the balls are again scattered. Grown now with a wife and young boy of his own, Goku and his Superman-like friends serve as planetary saviors and installers of peace through superior firepower.It takes only a few minutes to deduce that Dragon Ball Z features a lot of fantasy violence. Fists. Swords. Machine guns. Lasers. And when Goku or Vegeta transforms into a Super Saiyan, idle bystanders had better duck and cover. It’s not at all like Clark Kent popping into a phone booth; it’s like a nuclear bomb going off. Perhaps that’s why so many young fans are hooked despite the corny, dubbed dialogue. Viewers fancy themselves to be all-powerful like Goku, at least for a half-hour in imagination land.Positive lessons do emerge. Goku refuses to kill a scientist destined for evil because he "hasn’t done anything wrong yet." And he’s concerned with the welfare of innocent people. Profanities are rare (one "d--n" slipped into six days worth of back-to-back episodes), but a few sexual innuendoes creep in. Occasionally dark and disturbing spiritual fascinations are also built into the series much as they were in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.Violence has long been the hallmark of Japanese anime and American cartoons. But don’t assume Dragon Ball Z is the modern equivalent of Wile E. Coyote tossing anvils at the Roadrunner. This is heart-pounding, adrenalized mayhem aimed squarely at 10-year-old boys. Think of it as video sugar. Consume too much and children will get sick—and loopy.',animation
'familly_guy','Family Guy is, season in and season out, the most obnoxious show on broadcast television.I actually hate to say that. Not for fear of overstatement. And not for worry that I might hurt creator Seth MacFarlane\'s feelings. Frankly, I\'m concerned that if MacFarlane happens to stumble upon this review, he might use it as a publicity snippet, or perhaps print it out and hang it in his office as confirmation of a job well done. Is Family Guy crass? Vulgar? Offensive? Inappropriate? Of course—and those are perhaps the only things Plugged In and MacFarlane would agree on. But MacFarlane\'s not looking for my approval, or yours, or anyone else who might long for more family-friendly content on the tube. Family Guy\'s not for us. Mostly, it seems like it\'s for folks who just don\'t care anymore.The show centers around the Griffin family—a dysfunctional collection of roughly animated beings who live in fictional Quahog, R.I. Peter is the clan patriarch, the titular "family guy" who makes Homer Simpson look like Ward Cleaver. His wife, Lois, and teen children Chris and Meg gamely endure his boozy, uncouth shadow—all while suffering from a variety of neuroses themselves. And then there\'s Stewie, a veritable James Bond villain in diapers, who sometimes hurls homoerotic double entendres as he plots to take over the world. Brian, the Griffins\' ultra-rational, anthropomorphic dog, rounds out the family.We\'d like to tell you more about the characters but, honestly, there\'s not much else to tell. The family in Family Guy is less a collection of fleshed-out characters than a mishmash of two-dimensional (literally) cutouts used as grist for the show\'s one-liners. The gags drive the Griffins, not the other way \'round. Which would be OK … if the gags were actually funny.Oh, Family Guy has its moments, but they\'re pretty sparse. Some critics have called it a knockoff of The Simpsons—a show that, for all its own problems, is endowed with far more heart and wit, even now in its waning days. Instead of heart, Family Guy doles out animated nudity. Instead of wit, Family Guy gives us fart jokes. Most episodes are rife with sexually themed gags (including a recurring pedophilic character who tries to lure teen boys into his house), and many episodes dabble in racism, too. One in 2011 demeans the work of Alcoholics Anonymous and denigrates Christianity in the same breath. This series is regularly boorish, often vile and seems overeager, almost desperate, to shock: It\'s a 14-year-old boy smoking in front of his parents just to see what they\'ll do.As such, Family Guy is a pretty sad show. And that sadness is only emphasized by the way in which is seems to want to embrace old-fashioned entertainment. It regularly pays homage to movies and sitcoms from 20, 30 even 40 years ago. MacFarlane shows a fondness for elaborate musical numbers, recalling MGM\'s 1950s heyday. Its rhythm feels, at times, almost vaudevillian. Clearly MacFarlane has an appreciation for the entertainments our parents and even grandparents grew up with—but not enough of one to keep from dragging it down to his lewd level.In some ways, the program\'s opening song illustrates both its appreciation for old-school diversions and its unapologetic break from old-school values: Lois and Peter sing the theme—much as Archie and Edith Bunker did for All in the Family in the 1970s."It seems today all you see is violence in movies and sex on TV," Lois belts out. "Where are those good old-fashioned values on which we used to rely?" Peter chimes in.The only answer MacFarlane gives us—which we dutifully reiterate—is this: Don\'t look for \'em here.Episode ReviewsMay 22, 2011TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tv14"It\'s a Trap!" The Griffin family spoofs the Star Wars film Return of the Jedi in this hour-long season finale. Lois (as Leia) frees a mooning Peter (as Han Solo) from carbonite, allowing him to release a long-held bit of flatulence. The cast is nearly pushed into the mouth of a monster they call a "giant anus in the desert." They escape, but not before they strangle Jabba the Hutt to death, bloodily cut henchmen to ribbons and give themselves nasty laser wounds. On the Death Star, Stewie (as Darth Vader) tries to turn Chris (as Luke Skywalker) to the dark side. Chris ends up accidentally breaking Stewie\'s neck—making Stewie angry in the Jedi afterlife.The monster is crushed under a gate. Stormtroopers bloodily die. Ewoks eat one another. References are made to masturbation, menstruation, incest, homosexuality and rubbing body parts on food as a joke. Women are drawn wearing skimpy outfits, including Leia\'s golden bikini. Somebody makes an anti-Semitic remark. We hear "b‑‑tard," "a‑‑," "d‑‑n," "h‑‑‑" and several bleeped obscenities, as well as misuses of God\'s name.March 6, 2011TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tv14"The Hand That Rocks the Wheelchair" When neighbor Peggy Swanson leaves town, Meg is asked to look in on her paraplegic husband, Joe. The girl soon develops a crush on Joe, begins dressing provocatively and grows delusional. (She breastfeeds Joe\'s baby and gets angry with him for not having sex with her.) She frames Peggy to get her arrested and, when Joe rebuffs Meg\'s advances, throws herself in front of his moving car—hoping to become paraplegic too.Meanwhile, Stewie builds a machine to amp up his evilness. The device instead makes an evil Stewie clone, who nearly strangles Brian before cutting off the dog\'s tail and stuffing it down the "real" Stewie\'s throat. (We see Stewie vomit while Brian tries to reattach his bloody tail.) The Stewie clone kills a woman by cutting her in half. He steals her car and then shatters the Kool-Aid man (lapping up the liquid with his tongue). A sex-obsessed neighbor asks Lois to have sex with him before zipping away, leaving handcuffs, a gerbil and a porn magazine behind. References are made to PMS, gambling addictions, pedophilia and smuggling cocaine. Meg lies and steals a police car and gun. Characters beat each other (including kicks to the groin) and say "d‑‑n," "h‑‑‑," "douche" and some bleeped obscenities. They misuse God\'s name about a dozen times.',animation
'adventure_time_with_finn_jake','Once upon a time, before television and video games and indoor plumbing, children would sit around the hearth and listen to stories told by their parents or grandparents or slightly crazy uncles. They were children\'s stories. Sorta. Most had children in them, at least—children who might be attacked by wolves on the way to grandma\'s house or lured into massive gingerbread houses to be cooked and eaten. These children were always in danger of being eaten, it seems, or attacked by trolls or killed by their evil stepmothers. Ah, such carefree, innocent days those must\'ve been.Cartoon Network\'s hit show Adventure Time With Finn & Jake recalls, in a way, those curious stories told generation after generation. It looks cute and might seem innocent at first … but it\'s darker than you might think.The characters look as if they were drawn by particularly talented second-graders, full of bold lines and whimsy. Finn, the 13-year-old protagonist, is a dot-eyed little lad with waggly arms, a weird pointy-eared hat and time on his hands for—well, adventure. He\'s joined by his faithful dog, Jake, and together they keep the land of Ooo safe from such nefarious evildoers as the comically drawn Ice King—a lonely soul who occasionally kidnaps one of the land\'s many princesses in an effort to cajole her into marrying him. Finn, meanwhile, has a crush on someone known as the Bubblegum Princess (first name: Bonnibelle), who rides a rainbow unicorn (first name: Rainicorn) across her Candy Kingdom. Ooo can seem, on the surface, like a land created by Care Bears.But all is not what it seems. While not an explicit part of the story, Ooo is actually in post-apocalyptic shock from something residents call the "Mushroom War." Various countries and kingdoms are pocked with bits of bracken from a time before, and there\'s a suggestion that Finn is one of the relics—perhaps the last real human to survive.All Finn\'s friends and acquaintances are, um, less than human. The Bubblegum Princess is, for instance, a mishmash of bubblegum and human DNA. And Lich, one of many bad \'uns inhabiting Ooo, is a fearsome undead wizard. Sign Zombies (zombies that look like signs) shamble through the Evil Forest. A Demon Cat haunts a largish dungeon. Marceline the Vampire Queen—a sometimes sullen 1,000-year-old teen—boasts a father who is evil incarnate, a stand-in for Satan himself.Dark magic, it turns out, flies fast and furious in Ooo. In fact, almost everyone but Finn seems to have a knack for casting spells. Even his dog can shift shapes at will. So you can forget about those Care Bears—creatures who would most certainly blush underneath their fur at the very thought of some of the suggestive and crass things that happen in Ooo. In one episode, Jake spends time with his girlfriend Rainicorn in a closet—part of a "Seven Minutes in Heaven" game. Marceline, at one point, moves in with her boyfriend. Conversations about painful death are common, as are sly references to bad words or slimy situations. "I think if you put a bunch of wisecracking adults in a room together you can\'t help end up with something slightly subversive," Adventure Time creator Pendleton Ward told Animation World Network. "But I really think there is humor for adults and kids. And I think the stuff for adults just goes over the kids\' heads just like [Pee-Wee\'s Playhouse] or The Simpsons did. And that was another goal I had in mind was to make something that everyone could watch." Folks of all ages are watching Adventure Time. It\'s become something of a cult hit among high schoolers and college-age adults, who join their younger siblings around the television—our modern-day hearth—to take in Ward\'s bizarre, somewhat askew stories.Whether everyone should watch, though, is another matter—a dilemma not exactly solved by the creator\'s calm assurances. While Adventure Time might not make kids look under their beds for wolves or witches, it might make their parents a little afraid … of television.Episode ReviewsAugust 1, 2011TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tvpg"Memory of a Memory" / "Hitman" Marceline\'s ex-boyfriend, Ash, tricks Finn into magically removing the memory of them breaking up. Finn runs into various memories while exploring Marceline\'s head, including: One where Marceline\'s a little girl, playing doctor with a stuffed bear in the ruined wreckage of the world; another where Marceline picks her nose; and another where she and Ash move in together. Marceline later crawls into Finn\'s memories, where she sees him as little boy dancing in his underwear and singing about "fannies" and "buns." Marceline kicks Ash in the groin and repeatedly in the head. Finn chimes in, jumping up and down on his chest before a Monty Python-style foot comes down to squish the offending boyfriend.Ice King tries to seduce a pair of breakfast princesses with honey. Finn grounds him for a month, whereupon Ice King, very angry, wishes he could hit Finn and Jake. Since he can\'t, he goes online and hires a "hit man." When he learns that the spectral, mummy-like assassin plans to kill them instead of just hitting them, the Ice King tries to save them, and finally does so by freezing them. Ice King has posters of muscular, bikini-clad women in his workout room, and he tries to offer the hit man a pair of night vision, X-ray goggles for "when you have a lady houseguest." We see the naked rear of an animated goblin and hear characters make fun of Ice King\'s "bubble butt." A reference is made to being burned alive. Jake expresses regret at eating meat that came from Meat Man. Characters say "freaking," "dang," "gol" and a euphemism for testicles.',animation
'animation_domination_high-def','I remember a day when The Simpsons was controversial. There was a time when people would gnash their teeth over Bart\'s inappropriate behavior and Homer\'s penchant to strangle the lad. I recall news stories and even a protest or two. Now, of course, The Simpsons is considered by many to be solid family entertainment—a sweet (if sarcastic) look at all that makes America\'s nuclear units the nutty parfait they are. And sometimes, looking back on those days of outrage in the early 1990s, I wonder: Has The Simpsons gotten better? Or does it just look better by comparison?A powerful argument for the latter may be Fox\'s Animation Domination High-Def.Called ADHD for short, this new entertainment venture started off on the Internet as a cache of unrelated, often NSFW (not safe for work) animated shorts. Now Fox has found a home for it on the telly—an hour-long block after (but not too far after) Saturday night\'s primetime programming. The 10- to 12-minute cartoon featurettes will apparently rotate in and out of the lineup with the idea that some could become their own primetime shows. Just like The Simpsons. (Fox\'s website suggests that "Axe Cop" and "High School USA!" will be featured throughout the rest of 2013, then replaced by two others.)The Parents Television Council, after watching some very crude initial offerings on the Internet, called the snippets "horrifically graphic, ultra-violent, sexually explicit and profanity-laden." And, indeed, ADHD is plenty bad—often far worse than even the already repugnant Family Guy."High School USA!" is particularly troubling. It\'s a tweak of the innocent Archie comics of yesteryear, with high schoolers graphically reveling in sex, drugs and bad behavior—all with a satirical tongue in cheek, of course, but without a discernible moral anywhere. "Axe Cop" is less repugnant—reliably rated TV-14 rather than the TV-MA that\'s been assigned to "High School"—but it\'s hardly family-friendly viewing material. The stories (which we\'re told sprout from the mind of artist Ethan Nicolle\'s 5-year-old brother, Malachai) are violent, almost always free of any real positive message and sometimes revolting: A recent episode featured the titular Axe Cop battling an army of self-aware feces.It could get worse. Fox, it seems, is keeping some of its most objectionable cartoons off the television and on the Internet for now (where, ironically, they might be more easily seen by youngsters). Shorts featuring "Scientifically Accurate Spider-Man" (a nude webslinger who spews webs from his rectum) and "My Little Cowboys" (a riff on My Little Ponies featuring partially nude decaying corpses, according to the PTC) are not yet on the tube.But could they get there? The PTC believes so. In an article posted on the PTC website, Christopher Gildemeister writes, "Fox wants nothing more than to push this gore- and nudity-soaked, profanity-laden, utterly depraved trash at children. … And, ultimately, the block will also appear on prime-time TV. Oh, not this year, and maybe not for a couple of years; but Fox\'s own chairman has stated his determination to bring content like "My Little Cowboys" and "Scientifically Accurate Spider-Man" to prime time, where it will be viewed by millions of impressionable children. Remember: when Family Guy started, it too was intended for adults; and now, it airs in prime time, with Fox boasting that it is one of the top shows viewed by kids."If Fox gets its way, in just a few years from now, pre-teen children will be lured in by the sight of beloved children\'s icons like My Little Pony, Pokémon, and Spider-Man—and then exposed to full-frontal nudity, exposed genitals, dismembered female corpses, and sickening levels of violence and extreme content … all at the \'editorial discretion\' of Fox." I hope the PTC is wrong. But if executives there believe High School USA! may be just about ready for primetime, it gets pretty hard to quibble.Episode ReviewsAugust 3, 2013TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tvmaHigh School USA!: "Adderall/Sexting" Everyone\'s horrified that Blackstein doesn\'t have a club to put on his applications, so he pretends to be gay to join the gay club. "Adderall" then shows his parents weeping joyfully upon learning about his newfound sexual orientation, and his popularity skyrockets, particularly with girls who\'d never paid attention to him before. (They say really crude things about now wanting him sexually.) Blackstein is amazed to learn that being gay wasn\'t always so cool. Gags involve kids abusing Adderall, and a tricycle-riding tot complains that he can\'t drink when he takes the pills. We see and hear several crude jokes related to homosexuality. Characters talk about taking peyote and scalping people. They say the s-word (which is left unbleeped), "a‑‑" and "h‑‑‑." God\'s name is misused.In "Sexting," Brent sends a girl a picture of his penis. The pic is then forwarded to everyone at school, and Brent is mocked because of his shape. Marsh decides to correct the problem by encouraging all the guys in high school to sext pictures of their own penises. Everyone does so but Marsh, and before it\'s all over, there are scenes of public masturbation and graphic talk about erections. As the credits roll, we see slews of the episode\'s sexts, critical parts covered by black boxes. And earlier, naked guys run around a dressing room (with parts of their backsides sometimes visible). We\'re also shown a girl going to the bathroom. Characters say "b‑‑ch" twice and misuse God\'s name a half-dozen times. August 3, 2013TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tv14Axe Cop: "An American Story/Zombie Island … in Space" In the first mini-episode, "An American Story," we hear about Axe Cop\'s ancestor, Book Cop, and his family\'s ancient mission to protect the Secret Attack Almanac from the king of England. The king kills an underling via acid and sharks (and we see the man dissolve in the acid before the shark comes along and chomps on him). That\'s pretty much all the "story" we need to convey here. The rest is just gratuitous content: Thousands of soldiers die when Book Cop lifts up a huge swath of earth and crushes them. Others die in fiery conflagrations or from poisonous waves. A book kills a guy when it pierces his head. Picnickers die from eating poisoned cake. An eagle-person hybrid dies from a cannonball.In "Zombie Island … in Space," zombies kill and eat a guy, and their resulting feces take over the zombie colony. Then the excrement travels to earth, marries a queen and uses a magic scepter to make everyone in the world defecate—thus creating an army of super-poo. A battle ensues, and during the melee (and during others, too) zombies are beheaded and feces stomped on. We hear "bloody" and "h‑‑‑."',animation
'phineas_and_ferb','Animated (in more ways than one) stepbrothers Phineas and Ferb are whiling away what may be the longest summer vacation ever. But their elaborate, reality-twisting plans are constantly under assault by their tattling older sister, Candace—who goes so far as to snitch on the boys for "making a title sequence" at the beginning of every show. While the boys enjoy their seemingly endless summer break, their pet platypus, Perry, never takes a day off: Serving as a secret agent for the OWCA ("Organization Without a Cool Acronym"), Perry sneaks off to wage war against his nemesis, Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz. The resourceful platypus knows that eeeeviill never takes a coffee break, so neither can he.Co-creators Dan Povenmire (formerly a writer for Fox\'s Family Guy) and Jeff "Swampy" Marsh, unsuccessfully pitched the concept of Phineas and Ferb for 16 years before Disney finally took a chance on the show in 2007. Povenmire has described it as a cross between SpongeBob SquarePants and Family Guy—a kids\' show that adults can enjoy, too, with a slew of hip cultural references and a catchy song each episode to keep things interesting."I think it\'s great that the characters are cool, edgy and clever without the humor being mean-spirited," Marsh told Animation World Network. "It was important to us that they never did anything with any animosity." Episode ReviewsNovember 14, 2009TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tvg"What Do It Do" & "Atlantis" Phineas and Ferb is almost always packaged as a twofer, with two stories inserted into each new airing. In "What Do It Do," a strange, one-eyed rocket robot (courtesy of Dr. Doofenshmirtz) crashes into the family\'s front yard, and Phineas, Ferb and the gang decide to build another one (since they\'re not allowed to touch the first one), reverse engineering it to figure out what it does. Turns out, the thing\'s an anti-romance robot, programmed to extinguish candles, sweep away rose petals and otherwise spoil lovey-dovey moods. Meanwhile, "Atlantis" has Phineas and Ferb discovering the famed lost city, while Candace busies herself in a sand castle building contest and Perry battles Doofenshmirtz and his army of nasty houseplants. It\'s all fun and games until somebody gets smelly. And makers of kid-oriented cartoons often seem to feel that an episode can\'t be complete without some form of bathroom humor. These two stories do have a bit of that, but it\'s comparatively mild: A dog goes to the bathroom where he shouldn\'t, and Doofenshmirtz suggests that Perry smells bad when the platypus falls into one of the nasty scientist\'s fertilizer traps. When the gang traipses along the ocean bottom, one kid asks another, "Why is the water always so warm next to you?" That reference will likely go over young kids\' heads, as will passing references to Poseidon, the Greek god of the ocean. But they\'re there, nevertheless. As is the idea that Phineas and Ferb never really get permission to run off on their latest excursion—leaving Candace in a tattletaling frenzy.March 1, 2008TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tvg"It\'s About Time!" (Parts 1 & 2)The family goes to the local natural history museum, and Phineas and Ferb undertake to fix an unfinished time machine on display. It works all too well—much to the dismay of Candace. Meanwhile, Perry discovers that Doofenshmirtz has found a new nemesis (Peter the Panda), and Perry is crushed."It\'s not that I don\'t hate you anymore," Doofenshmirtz explains. "I do. But I just think it\'s time we take a break and start fighting other people." Phineas and Ferb may actually be the funniest regular feature on the Disney Channel. While Disney\'s wildly popular live-action shows can feel, at least to adults, a bit stiff and saccharine, Phineas is full of vim and wit—all without straying into problematic content. At least not too far. There is, after all, a bit of violence: A bevy of secret agent animals and evil scientists get into a knock-down, drag-out battle during a daytime talk show; a T. rex tries to eat Candace; and Doofenshmirtz tells Perry that he wants to get back to hurting him "the right way—with cartoonish physical violence and elaborate traps constructed out of strange things purchased on the Internet." When a security guard reprimands Candace for yelling in the museum, Candace talks back, sarcastically saying it\'d be a shame to wake anyone up.But I can\'t be too critical. After all, this is a show that, when Phineas and Ferb are marooned in the Jurassic Period with only a motorized scooter for transport, they immediately look for helmets—a sentiment any safety-conscious parent would approve of. Never mind that those helmets take the form of live turtles.',animation
'batman_the_brave_and_the_bold','These days, Batman is more likely to be seen as a brooding, troubled vigilante who struggles with dark evildoers and his own inner demons in equal measure. At least, that\'s the way he\'s seen in the movies. But on Cartoon Network, there\'s a more colorful caped crusader at work, as prone to uttering lame puns as trading fisticuffs with the nearest supervillain."Looks like the joke\'s on you, Joker!"In Batman: The Brave and the Bold, it sometimes can be hard to tell what hurts Batman\'s nemeses more: the superhero\'s right hook or his dry wordplay.This is the lighter side of Batman, a not-so-Dark Knight, if you will. Oh, perhaps he\'d be prone to give his glower a go if he had enough time and space to do it. But he has neither, thanks to Cartoon Network\'s tight template. In each stand-alone episode, Batman must battle baddies with the help of another superhero. Sometimes they\'re wildly popular protagonists, such as Wonder Woman or Green Lantern. But just as often they\'re pretty anonymous. (I don\'t think the folks at DC Comics are rushing to make a film based on Blue Beetle anytime soon.) With so many fellow superheroes to talk with and so little time to take down the barrage of bad guys, Batman has precious little time to do dour. The result is a show that feels lighter, brighter and sometimes sillier than Cartoon Network\'s first Batman incarnation, the brooding and much-lauded Batman: The Animated Series. It\'s part Powerpuff Girls, part Superfriends and part 1960s-era Batman. "I\'m calling in a big, Saturday morning bowl of cereal," producer James Tucker told CBR News. "It definitely harkens back to simpler times."All this makes The Brave and the Bold more kid friendly than some of Batman\'s other recent appearances. No character, to our knowledge, has impaled anyone with a pencil here. Yes, there\'s plenty of cartoonish violence, but rarely does it rise above what you\'d see in Powerpuff, and it\'s almost always nonlethal. (The series has dealt with Batman\'s origins, when Bruce Wayne\'s parents were murdered in a dark alley.) Batman\'s job looks fun again … not some sort of psychological coping mechanism.Gotham\'s streets haven\'t been completely expunged of dimness, of course. Animated women sometimes sport miniskirts or short shorts and low-cut tops (often in keeping with their original comic book outfits), and they can be prone to seduce certain crime fighters with their womanly wiles. The outlandish plots can feel, at times, downright mystical or magical. Merlin, for example, zaps Batman and Green Arrow into King Arthur\'s time during one early episode. And mummies and ghosts rise to do battle in others.That said, I\'ll return to my original point: This Batman gives us a heroic crime fighter who, even if he doesn\'t smile much himself, can coax a grin out of his audience. That\'s a Batman we\'ve not seen flap across our entertainment screens for a while, and he\'s been sorely missed.Episode ReviewsMay 27, 2011TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tvy7"Scorn of the Star Sapphire!"

"Have to say, being a secret agent is a cinch when you\'ve got a superpowered girlfriend," Steve says."I wouldn\'t know," Batman murmurs.In the main episode, Batman teams with Green Lantern to battle Star Sapphire, the deathless leader (she possesses a woman and forces her to do her bidding) of a band of otherworldly beings who hope to conquer Earth. Meanwhile, Green\'s having troubles with his girlfriend. So Batman, during one of their many battles together, advises Green to not take her for granted. "Leave her behind enough times [to fight crime] and she might not be there when you get back," he says.

'south_park','South Park, the brainchild of writers/animators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, put Comedy Central on the map in 1997—and continues to keep it there. The weird, gross, absurd, supernatural, outrageous and inane are all commonplace in the small, fictitious Colorado town of South Park—where four cynical, foul-mouthed fourth graders run seriously amok. Kyle, Stan, Cartman and Kenny push envelopes galore and are notorious for their crass, satirical and occasionally morbid lampoons of virtually everything. Religion, celebrity, euthanasia, politics, race and sexuality are only starting points for them. Absolutely anything even remotely controversial or popular is fair game for rancid ridicule here. In a few cases, the scorn South Park heaps on its targets might be deserved. But never from such a vulgar vantage point. And most of these spoofs, such as the "Super Best Friends" club—including a coke-snorting Buddha and an incompetent Jesus—are certifiably abusive. What\'s worse is this: In today\'s cable TV climate, such extreme behavior is exactly why this "equal opportunity" sitcom has reached its landmark 200th episode.It\'s won several Emmys and a Peabody award. And it\'s been named "Worst Cable TV Show of the Week" multiple times by the Parents Television Council. Wikipedia has a very long page devoted to "South Park Controversies."Episode ReviewsApril 14, 2010TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tvma"200" On a field trip to a candy factory, Stan sees "Tom Cruise" packaging fudge. The result is a string of harsh homosexual double entendres—which prompt an "outraged" Cruise and 200 other celebrities previously ridiculed on South Park to file a class-action lawsuit against the town.We\'d say blackmail and threats of violence were the order of the day except really it\'s more about a woman in a bikini vomiting and then wiping it on someone\'s crotch. It\'s about racial slurs. It\'s about vulgar and obscene references to hermaphroditism, intercourse and homosexuality. It\'s about being contemptuous of Jesus—and Moses, Mohammed and Buddha, too.Foul language in the online version of this episode includes multiple s-words. F-words are combined with Jesus\' name. God\'s name is commingled with "d‑‑n." "Barbra Streisand," in the form of a giant robot, shoots smoke from her breasts. A hairy man is shown wearing only a diaper. Another man is confined by full-body S&M gear. "Steve Irwin," the late wildlife-show celebrity, is depicted with a manta ray stabbing his bleeding chest.NOTE: After this 200th episode aired, creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone found themselves on the receiving end of a not-so-veiled threat from Revolution Muslim, a New York-based Islamic group known for making radical statements. Reacting to the episode\'s mockery of Mohammed, the group posted this admonition on its website: "We have to warn Matt and Trey that what they are doing is stupid and they will probably wind up like Theo Van Gogh [the Dutch filmmaker who was fatally shot and stabbed in 2004 over his documentary about Muslim women] for airing this show. This is not a threat, but a warning of the reality of what will likely happen to them." Comedy Central quickly stepped in to censor every usage of Muhammad\'s name in the follow-up episode ("201"), and has blocked the unedited version from being streamed online. Apparently understanding that many fans would think the bleeping was merely a continuation of the satirical storyline, Parker and Stone released this statement: "In the 14 years we\'ve been doing South Park we have never done a show that we couldn\'t stand behind. We delivered our version of the show to Comedy Central and they made a determination to alter the episode. It wasn\'t some meta-joke on our part. Comedy Central added the bleeps. In fact, Kyle\'s customary final speech was about intimidation and fear. It didn\'t mention Muhammad at all but it got bleeped too."March 11, 2009TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tvma"The Ring" The Jonas Brothers are everywhere. Even in South Park. Not the real Jonases, mind you. These South Park doppelgängers don\'t share much in common with the flesh-and-blood band other than hairstyles, an aw-shucks demeanor and … promise rings.The plot, in a nutshell, is this: Kenny hooks up with an "experienced" fifth grader who (everybody knows) performed oral sex on her last boyfriend in a parking lot. Kenny\'s jazzed about going steady with a "notorious whore," as his friends put it. And when he finds out that the Jonas Brothers make her all "tingly," he buys tickets to a concert. His sexually inspired plot backfires when his girlfriend is brought backstage to meet the JBs, who make her promise to wear a promise ring.Disney ultimately gets the rawest deal here, with Mickey Mouse insisting, "You have to wear the purity rings because that\'s how we can sell sex to little girls." Then, right before the credits, he spits out a massive, anti-Christian tirade, bragging about how he\'s made "billions off Christian ignorance for decades now.""That\'s it, girls," says a Christian father who hears the whole rant on television. "No more Disney TV for a while." The episode is staggeringly profane, featuring f-words along with a host of other curses and crudities. (We watched it on Comedy Central\'s website.) It\'s steeped in sexuality—from graphic innuendo to titillating language to a phallus made from snow. And it\'s at times brutally violent. Blood flies when mean Mickey beats the tar out of one of the Jonases.',animation

Network execs consider this to be savory dinnertime entertainment. But that\'s only because Fox defines a "family show" only by whether it has a family in it, not by whether families should watch it. And this cartoon\'s take on the modern nuclear family is purely Grade D Beef—lean on lessons, loaded with questionable additives and likely to give you indigestion. It\'s not completely without merit. Bob, our longsuffering restaurateur, digs his family in a mumbling, exasperated sort of way. Linda is devoted to her hubby in spite of his many faults, and she encourages him to pursue his short-order dreams no matter how many times he gets splashed with metaphorical fry oil. The Belcher children, for all their oddities, show flashes of near humanity. And episodes often conclude with a touchy-feely moment. But Bob\'s Burgers lacks The Simpsons\' warmth and—I never thought I\'d be writing this—tact. If The Simpsons is that college roommate who ate all your ramen without permission, Bob\'s Burgers is the guy who stole your refrigerator and set fire to your mother\'s quilt. Though it sometimes aims for the heart, its gags hit somewhere south of there. In other words, cleanly funny moments are as rare as tofu on Bob\'s lunch menu, never mind that the series was awarded an Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program. And while it\'s less objectionable than any one of Seth MacFarlane\'s slew of comedies (see: Family Guy), episodes are still filled with quips that give noxious nods to cannibalism, talking feces, bestiality and pedophilia, among other things. Bob once asked Gene, his son, if he could please stop using his bullhorn to make farting noises at folks passing by the diner. "There\'s a line between entertaining and annoying," Bob tells him."No!" Gene hollers. "That\'s a myth!" Which neatly sums up the philosophy, it would seem, of Bob\'s Burgers.Episode ReviewsDecember 7, 2014TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tv14"Father of the Bob" It\'s holiday time, and Bob\'s whole family moseys over to his father\'s diner for Bob Sr.\'s annual Christmas party. Bob, who never felt appreciated by his pops, puts a 15-minute limit on the visit. ("It\'s like speed dating with your dad!" Gene says.) But those plans quickly go awry, of course.Bob and Bob Sr. showcase some truly dysfunctional family dynamics, but Bob eventually apologizes while the two line dance … in a gay bar. While scouring Bob Sr.\'s basement for a present for his dad, Gene strips to his underwear and lounges in a box full of baked beans. He contemplates giving the "bean bath" to his dad as a gift (after adding a "little bit of pee"), but when the box breaks, he spends the rest of the episode running around in his underwear soaked in bean sauce. There\'s a wink at incest. Children pray to "Lord Santa," and when Bob says that Santa\'s not to be prayed to, Gene hollers, "Lord Santa, strike him down!" A patron can\'t decide whether to attend Christmas Eve services or play basketball. A sign in Bob\'s Burgers advertises a special: "Cheeses Is Born Burger." (And God\'s name is abused as well.) Linda believes "Christmas magic" may be contained in all manner of alcoholic beverages. Bob says "Merry Freakin\' Christmas," and we also hear "b--ch" (three times) and "d--n" (once).January 23, 2011TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tv14"Sacred Cow" A documentary filmmaker shows up at Bob\'s Burgers with a cow (actually a steer wearing a wig) named "Moo-lissa," demanding Bob either send it off to be slaughtered or apologize for his cattle-killing profession. Louise seizes the opportunity to create emoticons from the animal\'s feces, tricking Tina into believing the steer is communicating with her—"like Gram-Gram used to do." Moo-lissa, the cross-dressing steer, inspires a raft of bestiality-inflected jokes, from Gene\'s insistence that the animal\'s only a "4," to Bob\'s bizarre dream in which he ends up French kissing the animal. The filmmaker is unfamiliar with the anatomy of cattle, insisting that he "milked" it. When the animal urinates on Bob\'s rug, Gene is inspired to drop his drawers (we see his animated backside) and follow suit. We hear about Tina\'s bra, how Louise\'s gun license has been approved, a joke about how marriage emasculates men, and lots of talk about "murder" in the context of beef. We see cattle carcasses, cuts of meat and a bloody scythe whish through the air. Characters misuse God\'s name frequently, along with "a‑‑," d‑‑n" and euphemisms for the f-word.January 9, 2011TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tvpg"Human Flesh" Bob celebrates his restaurant\'s grand re-re-re-opening, but finds that business has slowed ever since Louise told her classmates that the burgers come from human meat. To make matters worse, a health inspector shows up and turns out to be Linda\'s ex-fiancé. Tina perpetually talks about her crotch itching. Characters blurt out sexually charged double entendres, and Gene makes flatulence noises with his bullhorn. Louise introduces a burger she calls the "Child Molester" (it comes with candy), and the family discusses which child would be more likely to be molested. Gene ends up feeling left out because his father thinks he\'s safe from predators—perhaps because he\'s overweight. Louise cheers him up by squeezing his cheeks and saying, "Who wouldn\'t want to molest this face?" Linda and Bob share a sloppy kiss. (Saliva drips from their mouths, and later Louise calls them a "couple of sluts.") Gene asks Linda if the health inspector is "going to be our new dad." Linda looks for an anniversary present in an occupied coffin. In a moment of despair, Bob tells himself that he and his entire family are failures. God\'s name is abused nearly a dozen times.',animation
'gravity_falls','Imagine Disneyland—its rides, its characters, its ever-smiling employees.Now imagine a place exactly like that—except without the rides, the characters or the ever-smiling employees. Imagine that the only thing remaining of the Happiest Place on Earth is a tacky gift shop with a fez-wearing con man counting cash up front and a dank, fake freak show out back.You\'ve just imagined the Mystery Shack, the main setting for Disney Channel\'s animated Gravity Falls. The main players in this supernaturally tinged toon are 12-year-old twins Dipper and Mabel Pines, living and working for the summer under the tutelage of their great uncle (or, as the show says, "Grunkle") Stan. It\'s he who runs the Mystery Shack and populates it with all manner of fabricated distractions, including muscle-bound Jackalopes (which he calls "Six Packalopes"), wax statues and "preteen wolf boys" (actually, Dipper plastered in dog hair). It\'s he who makes the Shack a tourist trap that even P.T. Barnum would have called tacky—though he does get a little help from his seasonal worker bees, aloof teen Wendy and goofy man-boy Soos. It\'s he who will do anything and everything to separate tourists from their cash.Except, that is, plunge into the surrounding forest and bring back some real mystery to the Mystery Shack. After all, the lands around Gravity Falls—a town just down the road from Twin Peaks and a stone\'s throw, it would seem, from Transylvania—are practically bursting with preternatural oddities, ranging from ghosts and gnomes to mermen and Manotaurs (very manly Minotaurs). Indeed, if you took Nickelodeon\'s show The Fairly OddParents, threw it into the Oregon forest and sprinkled it with a dash of The X-Files (if The X-Files had been created by Seth MacFarlane) you have a pretty good idea of what Gravity Falls looks like.The Los Angeles Times called Gravity Falls "gently twisted." And the show does have some edge to it—enough so that it would actually feel more at home on Cartoon Network than in the House of Mouse. That\'s to say it sometimes features content that brushes up against the limits of its TV-Y7 rating. It feels trendy and, yes, twisted, especially when you consider the age of its target audience. Dipper and Mabel go on semi-perilous adventures, engage in 12-year-old infatuations and learn only the thinnest of morals at the end of each episode. Grunkle Stan—despite his obvious affection for Dipper and Mabel—is perhaps the worst TV role model this side of J.R. Ewing.Slippery spiritual content—every bit of it played for giggles and guffaws—includes magic, incantations and crystals with the power to alter the world around them. Stan\'s hat evokes the idea of Masonic headgear, and we see other such icons scattered across the landscape. On the positive side of the ledger, the world of Gravity Falls doesn\'t douse viewers with the kind of sexual double entendres and teen sensibilities crowding Cartoon Network\'s Adventure Time or Regular Show. Language doesn\'t seem to go beyond the occasional "heck" or "butt." And characters seem to care for one another in their own whimsically flawed ways.Well, all the characters who aren\'t named \'Lil Gideon, that is. He seems borrowed directly from Family Guy.Episode ReviewsFebruary 15, 2013TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tvy7"Boss Mabel" Mabel tells Grunkle Stan that he could actually make more money if he was nicer to his customers. So Stan makes a bet with Mabel: He\'ll leave on vacation for three days and turn the store over to her. Whoever makes the most money wins.Right away, Mabel gets to the task of being nice. She encourages Soos to follow his dream of being a dancing question mark. She allows Dipper to drag in a real supernatural beastie from the forest. Etcetera. The results are disastrous. Dipper\'s monster destroys much of the Shack and sends tourists to the hospital. Soos is Maced. And Mabel devolves into a mini-Stan while trying to get things back on track. Stan, meanwhile, spends his vacation participating in a Wheel of Fortune-like game show, but loses all of his winnings when he bets everything on guessing one word: a six-letter word that people use to get something they want. Stan\'s guess of gimmee is wrong, and he learns that the please "can apparently make you money." Elsewhere, a wallet vomits up spare change. A tourist is hit by a stuffed head. Shack workers mark prices way up for the gullible tourists. Mabel jokingly suggests to a customer that she stick a bumper sticker over her husband\'s mouth. We see some slapstick violence. Stan lies and (sort of) steals. Characters say "butt" and "heck." Stan takes his clothes off on TV to prepare for a "cash shower." (Everything below the waist is shielded by a podium.) That question mark costume Soos wears reveals his underwear.',animation
'simpsons','My 23-year-old son has never known a world without The Simpsons. Fox\'s landmark animated show, which snagged its own half-hour sitcom slot back in 1989, has spoofed four sitting presidents, spanned 12 Olympics (summer and winter) and survived 25 "Treehouse of Horror" Halloween specials. It predates the World Wide Web, a united Germany and Forrest Gump. It has given us the Oxford English Dictionary-approved interjection D\'oh! while peddling literally billions of dollars of merchandise. It is now the longest-running scripted primetime series in American history, outliving even Gunsmoke and Lassie. Here\'s what all that means: The Simpsons has been around a long time—so long, in fact, that this review may not be able to tell you anything you didn\'t already know about this show. You\'ve probably already made up your mind about Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie. Either you watch (and consider The Simpsons to be a cogent, witty and surprisingly warmhearted satire of the American condition) or you don\'t (and think the cartoon is crass, lewd and morally impaired).To both camps, we have this to say: We couldn\'t agree more. [*Insert asterisk here.]Whatever you think about The Simpsons, there\'s no question it\'s become an indelible part of American culture—perhaps because in all its paradoxes, it resembles America itself. It\'s rebellious and conservative, wayward and moral, both woefully corrupt and whimsically cool. The Simpsons is like a funhouse mirror that may distort who we are, but there\'s enough of a resemblance that we instantly recognize ourselves in its crudely animated outlines.In the beginning, parents and pundits lambasted the show for its crude humor and lack of viable role models—while T-shirts featuring the grinning visage of Bart and the words "underachiever and proud of it" blanketed the country. The Simpsons was the family no one wanted to be but secretly wanted to visit, if only for a vacation from themselves. Their show for many (including a fledgling entertainment-review publication that would soon be called Plugged In) was both a symptom and a cause of a steep decline in our culture. Others thought, "It\'s about time we all loosened up a bit!"Underneath it all, something else was happening. Homer and his clan, for all their many, many faults, loved and cared for one another—and still do. In some ways, now in the second decade of a new century, they seem almost counterculturally old-fashioned. As our world tries to now decide if family—any sort of family—is needed at all, Springfield\'s first fam holds together, never minding the pressures of school, work, politics, media and the occasional natural (or unnatural) disaster. Indeed, Homer and Marge have stuck it out for better than three decades through thick and thin, sickness and health, high hair and no hair.Indeed, this bright-yellow family of five, for some Americans, has become shorthand for the nuclear family.But now we must come back to that asterisk inserted above. Because those Simpsons are nuclear in more ways than one—and not just because Homer sometimes comes home from work with radioactive trinkets in his pockets. Their show is still (and increasingly so) edgy, rebellious, lewd and crude. Homer is one of the worst dads … ever. Bart\'s loud and proud when it comes to underachieving. Sexual double entendres scatter out across Springfield like so much fallout. Over-the-top animated violence and gore doesn\'t restrict itself to just the embedded Itchy & Scratchy Show. Homer drinks beer like a dehydrated water buffalo. Patty and Selma smoke like Mr. Burns\' power plant after Homer throws a wrench in the reactor. And Mr. Burns\' lovesick assistant, Smithers, would do anything to start up a whole different sort of family with his usually oblivious boss. Speaking of such things, Patty "outed" herself 16 seasons in, and Homer has even officiated a same-sex wedding. Foreigners in Homer-land are, as London\'s Telegraph puts it, downright "weird, remote and funny." And while the Simpsons may wind up in church every Sunday (when Homer decides to skip in one episode, his house nearly burns down by way of "judgment"), the overall tone of episodes dealing with Christianity is skeptical at best, mocking at worst. (Note that creator Matt Groening is an equal-opportunity jokester in this arena. Hinduism, Judaism and Islam have all felt the searing heat of his sarcasm.)Many other potholes dot this primary-color landscape: Suicide, nudism, masturbation, bestiality, bullying and drug abuse are but a few. In short? Springfield\'s Simpsons does not exemplify an ideal family. Fox\'s Simpsons does not exemplify an ideal TV series. Neither was ever intended to. And thus, this show and its family may indeed be a symptom of a culture gone terribly wrong. Which can make it hard to see that it\'s also at times a symptom of what we\'ve done right.Episode ReviewsMay 4, 2014TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tv14"Brick Like Me" Homer and the rest of Springfield become LEGOs, forming a world where "everything fits with everything else and nobody ever gets hurt." But Homer begins to have visions of another existence, where everything seems to be made of meat and he has weird things on his hands. "If only I could put my finger on what they\'re called," he says. Marge takes him to church to find "airtight solace in religion," and the priest talks about how, in the beginning, "the Great Constructor scissored open bag one" before the "Great Sorting." Turns out the LEGO world is a figment of Homer\'s imagination. In "real" Springfield, Homer and Lisa bonded through LEGOs until Lisa was invited by some older girls to see the next Survival Games movie. ("I\'ve never been to a PG-13 movie before," she naively says. "I wonder what the one swear word will be?") The LEGO world, then, is Homer\'s way of keeping his little girl little forever … until he (ironically) realizes that "the fact that kids grow up is what makes time with them special."LEGO versions of Homer and Marge have sex. (We see them afterward, their plastic pieces scattered across the bedroom.) Homer wanders into the bathroom in LEGO underwear. The school superintendent and a lunch lady kiss in a broom closet.Homer is struck by a falling LEGO statue. Lennie and two surfers fight. Several LEGO creations, including people, schools and helicopters, are destroyed. Homer is served LEGO beer and is horrified when it becomes real beer.We see LEGO ghosts. Characters make up an advent calendar. Somebody misuses God\'s name. Homer says "Brick me!" Apu ends up thinking Homer is yelling at him to "go back where he came from." Homer tells reality to "kiss my flat, plastic butt."February 19, 2012TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tvpg"At Long Last Leave" To celebrate the show\'s 500th episode, the city of Springfield decides it\'s fed up with the family that made it famous and runs them out of town. The Simpsons wind up in the quaint-and-lawless Outlands. Then, one by one, as if they simply can\'t live without their neighborhood troublemakers, Springfield\'s citizens uproot and resettle in the Outlands too, re-creating their old metropolis by way of a Wild West-style motif.We\'re offered a nice thought or two about acceptance and neighborliness. But mostly the gags here center on flatulence, drugs, alcohol, homosexuality, masturbation, defecation, urination, drunken driving, physical abuse and underwear (or the lack thereof). Homer and Marge sneak back into town to find romance once again in their barricaded bedroom. "There\'s no sex like fugitive sex," he says, naked (but covered) in bed. They\'re caught. And Rev. Lovejoy suggests the family be crucified and buried. "Screw the bolder in tight" this time, he adds. Friends and foes alike force the Simpsons to participate in a "Simpsons go to hell" parade featuring a pitchfork-wielding demon. Someone suggests killing any Simpson they see wandering the street, trading their "pelts" in for a free soda. We hear "d‑‑n," "jeez" and a misuse of God\'s name.',animation
'my _little_pony','Back in my day, the airwaves were saturated with cheap cartoons made (at least in part) to sell toys. We boys got G.I. Joe and He-Man and Transformers. Girls had it worse: The Saturday-morning animated cartel determined that they would better appreciate, say, The Care Bears, The Smurfs and the original My Little Pony—bits of fluff with lots of innocuous plotting, insanely stereotypical characters, odd musical interludes and enough saccharine to gag a killer whale.My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic is a lot like that—only good. This latest My Little Pony incarnation (technically the fourth generation of a long-running toy/entertainment line) is one of pop culture\'s unlikeliest success stories. Launched in the fall of 2010 on the little-watched Hub, the Hasbro Studios production featured the exploits of bookish purple unicorn Twilight Sparkle and her Ponyville friends: the cowboy hat-wearing Applejack, bashful-but-kind Fluttershy, gregariously girlie Pinkie Pie, tomboy speedster Rainbow Dash, and über-fashionista Rarity. Its introduction was greeted with a universal nicker from most of the world. I mean, how revolutionary can a 22-minute commercial targeting 6-year-olds be?Pretty revolutionary, it seems.My Little Pony quickly became the Hub\'s most-watched program, and the audience kept building. By the end of the first season, 4 million people were tuning in. (To compare, the much-vaunted Mad Men\'s Season Six finale drew 2.7 million viewers—the highest in the show\'s history). Viewership has grown even more since then, and it wasn\'t just the intended audience—girls between the ages of 3 and 11. It became a raging hit among teen girls and twentysomethings too. Soon we began to hear about "bronies," young men who never miss an episode. Geek culture was awash in ponies. Mash-ups featuring Twilight Sparkle and her equestrian amigos began proliferating on YouTube. My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic became the most buzzy and blogged-about show this side of The Walking Dead. Why so successful? The series, it would seem, gives us a paradox: It\'s both remarkably hip and utterly guileless, simultaneously self-aware and sincere. Its writers are sharp and witty, offering nods to both the homegrown culture that\'s sprung up around the show and non-Ponyville pop culture as a whole. Example: When Weird Al Yankovic lent his voice to a pony recently, bursting into melody, Pinkie Pie asks him, "Did you just steal my song?"And yet there is not a hint of knowing irony to be found anywhere. It\'s as if the land of Equestria does not allow postmodern cynicism to enter its borders. Absolutely no eye-rolling allowed. It\'s all very sweet, but not sickeningly so. Nice, but feisty.No televised phenomenon is without its detractors, of course. Writing for a Ms. Magazine blog, Kathleen Richter began with the headline "My Little Homophobic, Racist, Smart-Shaming Pony," and then went on to wonder why black ponies were subservient to a white-winged unicorn and argue that Rainbow Dash was intended to give the impression that "all feminists are angry, tomboyish lesbians." Admittedly, Rainbow Dash does exhibit a rainbow, now a symbol of the gay movement, but My Little Pony has always featured rainbows, going back all the way to the days of Noah himself. (Besides, creator Lauren Faust directly refuted Richter\'s assertions.) My take: The ethos in question informs us that people with different personalities and interests can still be the best of friends. A pretty good message, I\'d say.There is magic, of course. Flying horses and unicorns can make things float or, if they\'re in a fix, zap things with magical blasts. Pegasi can alter the weather. Considering the very youngest of viewers for a moment, I should note that the show does feature some kinda scary monsters at times, and that ponies can land in perilous situations. And because the show does try to teach little lessons on occasion, it\'s almost guaranteed that a few of them won\'t line up exactly with your family\'s values.Overall, though? My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic turns out to be far more than just a half-hour of product placement. Sweet messages and surprising wit coupled with a serious amount of sincerity help this little hoofer soar.Episode ReviewsFebruary 1, 2014TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tvy"Pinkie Pride" Pinkie Pie\'s primacy as the pinnacle party-planner in Ponyville is piqued when a pony named Cheese Sandwich (voiced by Weird Al Yankovic) clops into town. "Be it wingding, hoedown, hootenanny or shindig, I\'m your pony," he says. And he wants to horn in on the process of planning Rainbow Dash\'s birthaversary party.Pinkie feels overshadowed by the flashy Sandwich and wonders whether she should give up party planning altogether. But then she challenges Cheese to a "goof off," wherein the person who can make Rainbow Dash laugh will be the party\'s official headliner."And the loser?" Twilight Sparkle asks."Doesn\'t," Pinkie says, a foreboding chill in her voice.But after realizing the competition itself is spoiling Rainbow Dash\'s party, Pinkie Pie graciously forfeits, and her friends tell her that she\'ll always be Ponyville\'s best resident party planner. Better yet, Cheese and Pinkie join forces to give Rainbow Dash the best party ever. January 25, 2014TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tvy"Three\'s a Crowd" Twilight Sparkle is entertaining her visiting sister-in-law, Princess Cadance, and plans for the two of them to spend the day at an exhibit of artifacts from the famed magician Starswirl the Beard. Alas, Discord arrives to make a mess of things: The tellingly named mismatched dragon has what he calls the "Blue Flu" and wants some serious care. "Isn\'t that what friends are for?" he asks. "Taking care of each other?"Twilight and Cadance reluctantly tend to the dragon until he tells them that there is a cure: a flower found at the other end of Equestria. When they find the huge flower and pluck it, a massive worm-beast (tentacles flapping out of its mouth) attacks the ponies. They finally force the worm back into its hole with blasts from their horns. When they return to Discord, they discover that the dragon made the whole sickness up. "You passed the friendship test!" he says. And while Twilight\'s bummed that her day with Cadance was spoiled, Cadance replies, "We may not see each other very often, but I know you\'ll always be there when I need you. Just like she was there for you, Discord."Oh, Discord sneezes on people and blows into a handkerchief (which then flaps away). He sneezes away a house, revealing a pony standing by a bathtub, her hair wrapped in a towel.',animation
'beavis_and_butt-head','In the early age of adult-targeted television animation—before Stewie had hatched his first nefarious plot on Family Guy; before Stan and Kyle had hurled their first profanity on South Park; before Maude Flanders was killed by a T-shirt cannon on The Simpsons—there was Beavis and Butt-head.Lots of folks now know Mike Judge for his King of the Hill series on Fox. (It ran from 1997 through 2010.) But it was four years earlier, in 1993, that he launched his landmark satire of—and salute to—adolescent stupidity on MTV\'s still-hip shores. Beavis and Butt-head featured two teen doofuses (doofi?) with a yen for girls, fire and heavy metal, and who were at their happiest—and most cogent—while watching music videos. When they dared get off their couch things got messy: Invariably, they\'d wind up trashing their neighbor\'s yard or destroying a teacher\'s beloved eight-track collection or driving Principal McVicker to guzzle gallons of Old Crow. Now, after a 14-year respite, the boys are back—back on the couch, back in school, back to their old exploits on MTV. Even their moldering Metallica and AC/DC shirts are back, making them look as though they\'d been stored in a cryogenic freezer and simply dug their way out. Never mind that MTV dumped its music videos for reality television a long time ago. Pay no attention to the fact that the United States has been through three presidential elections, two wars and an interminably long recession. To paraphrase Mike Judge himself, stupidity never goes out of style. The original Beavis and Butt-head was as moral-free a half-hour on TV as one was likely to find in the \'90s—"a satirical exaggeration of American instant-gratification taken to its logical extreme," according to Time television critic James Poniewozik. "[Beavis and Butt-head] represented—on pop culture\'s most prominent outlet—a brutally funny takedown of pop culture and the dumb, lazy egocentrism it catered to. The sugar rush of empty-calorie consumer society, it told us, makes Cornholios of us all." But not everyone found the show funny. Social critics contended that Beavis\' and Butt-head\'s antics sometimes influenced youth in the real world. And MTV paid them some mind, too, deciding to stop pyromaniac Beavis from uttering the word fire after a 5-year-old boy allegedly set his own house ablaze, killing his 2-year-old sister. (He\'d supposedly been watching the show, but doubt was cast on the cause-and-effect scenario months later when friends insisted the family didn\'t even have cable.) Forget about whether the tragedy was triggered by the boys, critics said: Beavis and Butt-head was still a horrible influence on the culture. And MTV soon sequestered the series to an 11 p.m. timeslot and started including a disclaimer:"Beavis and Butt-head are not real. They are stupid cartoon people completely made up by this Texas guy whom we hardly even know. Beavis and Butt-head are dumb, crude, thoughtless, ugly, sexist, self-destructive fools. But for some reason, the little wienerheads make us laugh."Perhaps it\'s a sign of the times that this new iteration feels almost warmly nostalgic. No, it\'s not any better: It\'s just as stupid and profane as ever (and Beavis even gets to obsess over fire again). But while the show was pushing the envelope in the early \'90s, its content utterly fails to shock now—not in a television landscape that includes the likes of Jersey Shore, The Walking Dead and Sons of Anarchy. It is, in a very (very) strange way, a little of what The Lawrence Welk Show was in the early days of MTV itself—a reminder of a more "innocent" time.But even in all its retro-salacious stodginess, Beavis and Butt-head still has the ability to satirize the culture surrounding it. And in some ways, the fact that Butt-head still wears braces after 22 years could be read as the ultimate poke. Consider: We live in an age obsessed with youth, an age in which we pride ourselves on never growing up. Fortysomethings shop at Forever 21 and celebrities Botox themselves into a state of freakish plasticity in the pursuit of eternal agelessness. Perhaps these two boys, still as young, immature and rudderless as ever, speak tomes to our obsession with youth—and suggest, in their own ridiculous and profane way that it\'s OK to grow up after all. Indeed, that if you don\'t, you\'re doomed to remain as dumb as they are.Episode ReviewsOctober 27, 2011TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tv14"Werewolves of Highland/Crying" Beavis and Butt-head are introduced to the "fact" that vampires and werewolves are so popular because "they have conquered death and have been touched by evil, so they\'re forbidden," making them "irresistible to women." The two immediately decide they want a piece of that, so they bribe a snaggletoothed homeless man (whom they mistake for a werewolf) to bite them. He does so repeatedly, producing huge red gashes and welts all over their bodies, and infecting them with, among other things, staph, gonorrhea and hepatitis A, B and C. But even while in comas at the hospital they start giggling when the nurse changes their catheters. Elsewhere, Beavis starts weeping while the two watch The Bachelor. The tears are actually precipitated by an onion, but that doesn\'t stop Butt-head from mocking his pal for his supposed sensitivity. (He\'s still doing it decades later when Butt-head keels over dead in a retirement home.)The two make crude references to anatomical body parts. They mock Jersey Shore, lamenting, "This is another one of those episodes where they don\'t have sex and they don\'t fight." They slam J-Woww for calling her made-up grandkids "b‑‑ch." "You\'re the best grandma ever, Grandma J-Woww," says Butt-head. "Please don\'t hit us again," says Beavis. They take issue with a video (which we see too) in which a child cries from fright when he\'s accosted by mangled bodies and gory undead predators. And they watch another featuring a magic-doling preschooler who tortures a man (whom they brand as a child molester). Characters say "d‑‑n," "a‑‑," "h‑‑‑," "b‑‑ch" and, of course, "butthole."',animation
'legends','LegendsBeing an undercover operative would be the pits.Let\'s set aside all the obvious issues like being discovered and killed and all that. Just ponder the logistics: First, you\'ve got to be an entirely fake person—maybe even several fake people, if you\'re really good. And all those fake people would need real stuff: cars and jobs and bank accounts. And how do you, Mr. or Mrs. Fakery, keep track of all those IDs and passwords for your fake identity, hmmm? I can barely handle the 27 passwords I have for my real self, much less if I added another 27 for fake offshore accounts and Facebook pages. Man, it took me 10 minutes to find my car keys this morning—and I only have one set. You think I could be trusted to keep track of an entirely new believable-yet-fraudulent human?It\'s a truly rare person who can be a quality undercover operative—to create "legends," as they\'re called, out of the ether. Martin Odum is one of those few. Martin is a top FBI mole, able to change his person like most of us change socks. Give the guy a little hair gel and he\'s an aging punk rocker, a pair of specs and he\'s a Wall Street honcho. Sure, he wouldn\'t make a believable boy band crooner—but there\'s only so much a fiftysomething FBI operative can be expected to do. This is one master of subterfuge who is so good at what he does that sometimes even he can be fooled.I\'m not kidding. While Martin\'s undeniably gifted, he\'s also a teensy bit unhinged. He has a tendency to morph into his characters too easily and too deeply. He\'s even been known to sign alimony checks to his ex, Sonya, using one fake name or another. And now he\'s not even sure whether he\'s Martin Odum to begin with: Some mysterious guy just told him his entire life may be yet another legend.The team of agents who surround our hero try to keep him on task. Crystal serves as his handler (and one-time lover). Maggie and Troy fill in the chinks of tech and ground support. Nelson oversees them all. So are these folks Martin\'s workmates? Friends? Shadowy watchdogs? Who knows? But if things get too weird at the office, Martin can always go and spend some quality time with his adoring son, Aiden ... who may or may not be his son.Despite all this mystery, TNT\'s Legends still feels like a fairly straightforward show. This is no high-prestige drama, determined to rack up scads of Emmy nods while throwing Game of Thrones-level sex and violence onto the screen. Nor is it a trite-if-clean lark fit for the whole family. There\'s piles of violence, but no organs falling to the ground. There\'s sexual content, but no bare breasts. There\'s foul language (that can even include the occasional s-word), but it\'s not obscenely unremitting. But if Legends doesn\'t outright push the envelope, it doesn\'t give us much incentive to open it up, either. While Martin and his "team" display quantities of courage and comradery, there don\'t seem to be too many deep themes waiting for exploration here, no grand lessons on the verge of being taught. Anchored by British actor Sean Bean—a fantasy fan favorite for his work in Peter Jackson\'s Lord of the Rings trilogy, as well as HBO\'s Game of Thrones—Legends\' early publicity has revolved around a campaign designed to convince the show\'s writers not to "kill" the oft-offed actor. The hashtag #dontkillseanbean made the rounds on Twitter, and several celebrities, including 24\'s Kiefer Sutherland and Game of Thrones author George R.R. Martin, have been seen sporting T-shirts bearing the slogan. Bean himself made a promotional video for the website Funny or Die in which he eventually "encourages" TNT to kill him off by way of piranha.Personally, I\'d like to see Sean Bean survive the series. No actor should have to perform a death scene in everything he does, especially not an actor as good as he. But when it comes to a long life for Legends itself ... well, I\'m not so sure I\'ll be rooting for that. Maybe one of my other selves will have to, but I won\'t.Episode ReviewsAugust 19, 2014TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tv14"Pilot" Martin becomes a stuttering militia fanatic to infiltrate the Citizens Army of Virginia, a homegrown terrorist organization. Meanwhile, a man tells Martin that he\'s not who he thinks he is. "You don\'t know where your life begins and your legend ends," he says. The mysterious "informer" is later stabbed by an unknown woman and bleeds to death on a subway platform. Someone working with Martin is severely beaten and then killed by the Citizens Army: We see him duct-taped to a chair, part of his face covered in blood, as men drag in a pail of water and a car battery with jumper cables. Several people are shot—sometimes wounded, sometimes killed. A guy is assaulted and later found dead in his apartment. Martin and Crystal nearly get executed with pistols. Characters get in fistfights. Martin meets Citizens Army thugs in a strip club, and we see scantily clad performers in the background. In order to get a message to Martin, Crystal goes undercover herself as a stripper (her bra-and-panty outfit leaves little to the imagination) and gives Martin an onscreen lap dance. We hear that the two slept together once, with Crystal saying it was a "mistake." Characters drink whiskey. They say the s-word, "b--ch," "h---," "a--," "p---ed" and "d--n," all once or twice each. We see the word "b--tard" on a computer screen. Undercover, Martin spits out a racial slur.',crime
'lie_to_me','Lie to MeOne of the following statements is false.A) When I can, I spend my weekends hiking.B) I\'m scared of large fish.C) I\'ve seen every Matlock episode made.OK, so what do you think? Can\'t figure it out? Well, don\'t blame yourself. Unless you\'re my mother (Hi, Mom!), you probably don\'t know that much about me. And it\'s hard to pick up dishonesty in the written word. For all you know, I hit the keys a little harder when I lie or write a little slower. But the words look the same.Now, if I gave you the same spiel while we shared coffee, you\'d figure out my lie before I took my second sip. Because I\'m actually a terrible liar.In the ethos of Fox\'s crime drama Lie to Me, we\'re all terrible liars. We reveal our falsehoods with every shimmy of our eyebrows, every twitch of our mouths. These little tics, called micro-expressions, are involuntary—dead giveaways to someone like Dr. Cal Lightman.Tim Roth\'s Lightman is one more of television\'s brilliant-yet-socially-inept mystery solvers. He may be abrasive and acerbic, but he\'s never, ever wrong. The guy heads a consulting firm called The Lightman Group—an organization staffed top to bottom with lie-detecting savants: Dr. Gillian Foster helps smooth out some of Lightman\'s rough edges, while Ria Torres and Eli Loker serve as youngish understudies. Each episode launches this fib-hunting foursome into our land of lies—and judging from Lightman\'s posh offices, they don\'t get paid by the hour.Cases are sometimes ripped right from today\'s headlines and are almost always self-contained, making it seem a bit like a TV network security blanket: You know what you\'re going to get when you watch it. Which is not to say Lie to Me is simple or simplistic. Indeed, the program is sometimes thought-provoking and often aspires to complexity. The good guys don\'t always do good things, and the bad guys aren\'t altogether bad. These messy morality tales, at their best, force viewers to re-evaluate their sense of fair play. And in doing so, they offer this moral message: Lying (even done with good intentions) will lead to trouble. If the Bible says "Thou shalt not lie" (and it does), this show adds, "And if thou dost, The Lightman Group shall catch thee." But here\'s where the show starts rubbing a bit: To get at the truth, Lightman and his team often lie like the dickens—to their subjects (to crack a case) and to each other (you\'d think they\'d be able to catch those). It has other problems, too—most of which are largely dependent on each story\'s subject. In one episode, viewers might be subjected to violent scenes of battle. In another, they might see bikini-clad dancers writhe around stripper poles. So is Lightman and Co. all about "the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth"? Is a TV show ever?Regarding my quiz … I don\'t care for light gray suits.Episode ReviewsJune 28, 2010TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tv14"React to Contact" An Iraqi war vet, apparently struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder, nearly shoots his son while "protecting" his home from imaginary invaders. Lightman discovers that PTSD isn\'t all that\'s eating at the sergeant: He\'s keeping a painful secret buried so far down in his brain that even he doesn\'t know the truth—and it\'s up to the doctor to pull it to the surface. The show features video simulations of and flashbacks to a firefight in Iraq, where soldiers, insurgents and even an armed 10-year-old got shot and killed. One soldier has his eye shot out (blood streaks the man\'s face), and explosions and gunfire pock the screen. We see bruises on a boy\'s arm and hear talk about child abuse and an extramarital affair. Characters curse ("d‑‑n," "a‑‑," "b‑‑tard," "bloody") and make references to smokeless tobacco and alcohol.',crime
'blacklist','BlacklistRaymond "Red" Reddington is one bad dude. He oozes felonious activity. His wardrobe (complete with black fedora) exudes fashionable evil. His I-know-ever-so-much-more-than-you attitude would make James Bond\'s adversaries at Spectre prickle with jealousy. Even his nickname—Concierge of Crime—seems to channel comic book villainy. So what, pray tell, is Red doing working with the FBI? Turns out he has a list (that\'d be the Blacklist, naturally) of the world\'s most dangerous criminals—guys so good at being bad that the FBI doesn\'t even know about them yet. The names on the list are criminal whales, Red says, and he wants to play at Ahab for a bit.But do brilliant criminal masterminds really wake up one morning and say, "You know, I\'m done with this black fedora. I want to be known as the Concierge of Conscientiousness from here on out"? Moreover, Red still seems awfully friendly with some of the folks he\'s helping the FBI bring in. So the Bureau\'s pretty sure Red\'s hiding something. What? Well, they don\'t know, and Red\'s not about to color in the picture for them. He is in the mood to make demands, though. "If you want the whales on my list, you have to play by my rules," he says. And the biggest rule of all? He\'ll only work with newbie criminal profiler Elizabeth Keen. He\'s obsessed with Liz for some reason, and seems to know an awful lot about her past. The Blacklist is both a clever and contrived crime thriller. It seems predicated on the predator-prey dynamic between Red and Liz—a relationship built on mutual respect and distrust. It has some serialized elements to it—a long-game mystery that will be doled out episode by episode, season by season. But it\'s also something of a pedestrian episodic drama along the lines of Person of Interest, with the FBI dutifully pursuing, each week, a new man on Red\'s nefarious list. Sexual material has included hookups and partial nudity. And in Season 2, our not-so-good-girl detective keeps her one-time husband and all-time spy illegally captive, hoping to use his intel to find—and perhaps kill—a notorious terrorist. But if Blacklist feels, at times, a little like Silence of the Lambs, it does not indulge that movie\'s serial killer depravity. Red is a wicked white-collar criminal and agent of global terrorism, but he\'s no up-close-and-personal serial killer. As such, we do not suffer the same level of grotesquery we do in Hannibal, Dexter or The Following.But this is still a violent show, and sometimes extremely so. Extras die by the dozens. People are shot, sometimes spraying blood as they die. Others are beaten or even tortured—with little of the resulting pain and gore hidden from viewers. And the lines the good guys are willing to cross to bring the bad guys to sometimes terminal justice seem to grow more gray by the episode.Episode ReviewsNovember 3, 2014TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tv14"The Scimitar" Samar, an agent from the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad who teams up with Keen and Co., seduces and apparently kills an Iranian nuclear physicist. We see her and the guy share drinks in a hotel bar and make out in a hallway. A short time later he falls from a 12-story window. (We see his lifeless, bloodstained body on the top of a crushed car.) In retaliation, Iran sends an assassin codenamed Scimitar to kidnap and kill a U.S. nuclear scientist.It\'s an open question as to what Keen will do with her ex-husband (whom she\'s holding captive to probe him for secret spy stuff) when his usefulness ends. "Just do me a favor," he tells her. "Look me in the eyes when you do it." Gunfire gives way to a tossed grenade that flips Keen\'s SUV. She stabs a captor with a syringe filled with sedative. We see some hand-to-hand combat and gunplay. Red drugs and kidnaps a young woman. There\'s an apparent revenge killing. (Red and Samar are involved.) We hear about previous killings, some of them gruesome. Keen pulls a pair of medical pins up through the skin of her arm. Keen\'s partner, Ressler, battles drug addiction; we see him dump pills down a drain. We hear "h---" and "d--n" three or four times each and "b--ch" once. God\'s name is wrongfully interjected a few times.

Liz\'s husband nearly dies at the hands of the terrorist who tapes him to a chair and is seen beating him and stabbing him in the leg and gut with a knife. (Blood is everywhere.) The terrorist is later shot twice and falls to his death from the top of a building.We see Liz with blood streaking her face. She suffers through a smoke bomb/tear gas attack. She stabs a guy in the neck with a pen as a way of making him talk. (We see the blood stain the man\'s neck and shirt, as well as a close-up of the pen.) Vehicles crash. People die in hails of bullets. Evildoers pour gasoline on a bridge and set it on fire. We see a picture of a supposed corpse. Liz is shown in bed in her underwear. Characters say "h‑‑‑" (four or five times) and "b‑‑ch" (three or four). They misuse God\'s name once or twice. They drink wine and champagne. We hear that Red ran out on his own family, years before, at Christmastime. But Liz and her husband are in the process of adopting, and she\'s elated when she learns that they might be bringing home a little girl. "Our family is the only thing that matters," she tells her husband—though that may change, given her job and the big secret her hubby\'s been keeping.',crime
'cold_case','Cold CaseIf Jerry Bruckheimer does many more television shows, they’re going to have to name a network after him. His production credits already include CSI, CSI: Miami, Without a Trace, The Amazing Race and now Cold Case, yet another procedural cop series that offers up-to-the-minute thrills by blowing the dust off of decades-old, unsolved murders. They’re called “cold cases” and Philadelphia detective Lilly Rush (Minority Report’s Kathryn Morris) finds herself inexorably drawn to them. To breathe fresh life into them. To resurrect the passion, conflict and sorrow they caused. And to put killers behind bars.Time heals all wounds, they say. Try telling that to a woman who, when she was five, found her mom blown to bits in the laundry room. Nobody’s ever been convicted, or even arrested for the death—until Lilly unearths her case. And when Lilly latches onto a new challenge, she never backs down. “I thought things would be different by now, that I’d be different,” a family member of a murder victim tells Lilly. “Time makes things worse, not better.” The detective’s response? “Maybe time also finds the truth.”A side benefit of a series that continually shows old crimes brought into the light of day and forgotten felons facing hard time is that viewers are reminded there’s no statute of limitations on pain. What we do affects others, sometimes for a very long time. It also serves as a sobering reminder that a person’s sins will surely find them out (Num. 32:23).The Cold Case premiere contained some of prime time’s harshest language, but subsequent episodes have included virtually no profanity at all. Sexual content is an issue inasmuch as it relates to crimes (one plotline examines the habits of a serial rapist), not the personal lives of the cast. Violence appears in stylized flashbacks designed to invoke a melancholy nostalgia as they illustrate brutality. Specific examples include explosions, gunfire, rape, strangulation and vicious beatings (the series has developed a fixation on angry men who abuse and hate women, which magnifies Lilly’s achievements as a female officer).Cold Case is Without a Trace part deux, not CSI: 1978. For that families should be grateful, but still mindful of sobering subject matter, smatterings of foul language, images of drug abuse and flashes of violence.',crime
'blind_justice','Blind JusticeSteven Bochco has a thing for the human posterior. The creator of NYPD Blue made headlines in 1993 by flashing Dennis Franz’s bare backside. His newest cop series, Blind Justice (ABC), waited about five minutes before showing a naked rear—this time on a bound-and-gagged female corpse. Viewers saw another nearly bare bottom in the second episode. Consider it a case of the gluteus maximized.That decision to focus on the underside of life is typical of Blind Justice, which tells the story of Detective Jim Dunbar (Ron Eldard), a hero cop blinded during a shootout with a bank robber. Determined not to be sidelined, he sued to be reinstated as a police officer, despite his disability. That’s how he winds up at a precinct in the Bronx working with crime fighters uncomfortable taking dangerous assignments with a guy who needs a guide dog just to cross the street.Dunbar’s first day back on the job finds police searching for a serial killer who leaves his female victims bound, gagged, naked and with their tongues cut out. Detectives Selway and Russo (Reno Wilson and Frank Grillo) are hot on the case, as is Karen Bettancourt (Marisol Nichols)—until she gets paired with Dunbar. That’s when she’s shunted off to investigate a routine car theft. Can you spell r-e-s-e-n-t-m-e-n-t?Dunbar does have certain talents. While not quite Daredevil, his blindness has heightened his other senses. And his street smarts remain intact. He’s a deft questioner at crime scenes and in the interrogation room. Slowly, Bettancourt comes to appreciate her new partner, and they turn out to be a good team.Being a Bochco drama, the cop stuff is only part of the story. Dunbar had cheated on his wife shortly before being blinded, and that betrayal simmers barely below the surface even as his wife (Rena Sofer) heroically lives out the “in sickness and health” clause of her marriage vows. Compounding the insult, he refuses to let her help him with simple things such as tying his tie. Eventually, however, her faithfulness transforms her husband.Blind Justice also bears the Bochco stamp for some rough language, including an extremely crude sexual put-down hurled at Bettancourt by another cop. Also problematic, Dunbar cuts ethical corners. For example, he advises a victim to lie to her boss about the circumstances of the crime, and tells Bettancourt to withhold information from their superior so they won’t be pulled from a case.Despite Steven Bochco’s talent for creating riveting stories and compelling human drama, his penchant for harsh realism that aims below the belt will have wise families searching for reruns of Sue Thomas: F.B.Eye.',crime
'awake','AwakeDreams are funny things. Rarely do we see them for what they are when we\'re in them. Rarely do we question why we\'re eating lunch with Condoleezza Rice and our long-dead grandmother in a quaint Thai restaurant. In the moment, we merely think, "I hate Thai food!" and scan the menu for a hamburger. Our dreams feel real enough. And sometimes our waking lives can feel rather dreamlike. Which is why most of us can relate—albeit ever-so-dimly—to Michael Britten.Michael, a homicide detective, is back at work after he and his family suffer a tragic car crash—one in which not everyone made it out alive. But who died, exactly? Michael doesn\'t know. At night, he might settle into bed next to his wife, Hannah, as they silently grieve for their teenage son, Rex. And then he\'ll wake up and send Rex off to school—and both will try to push past the loss of Hannah.Michael\'s living two lives, but he can\'t tell which is reality and which is merely a dream. Nor does he dare intentionally mess up either life to find out. So desperate is his situation that he begins wearing colored rubber bands on his wrist to tell the two realities apart: When his wife\'s alive (sequences filmed in warm, almost sunset-like hues), he wears a red band. When it\'s his son (seen in cooler, starker tones), he wears a green one.In the midst of all this, Michael still has a job to do: People are still being murdered with frightening regularity in both of his worlds. "All I end up doing is work twice as many homicides," he complains to one of his two psychologists. Talk about burning the candle at both ends. It gets weirder: A clue found in one reality might bleed over into the other, helping him solve a supposedly unrelated case. A family secret uncovered in one might help ease some pain in the other. Sometimes it feels as though these two worlds are working together. At others, both seem to mock him.Is he crazy? Or is all of this merely an understandable coping mechanism for unimaginable loss? Could both realities be real? Could they both be unreal? Is it possible that Michael, through this bizarre double life, is trying somehow to piece together what really happened to his family? These questions are, naturally, unanswerable in the show\'s early going. But if Awake somehow finds a way to keep its novel sci-fi twist alive and vibrant, they may be worth considering in more depth. And they have the potential to open up some interesting philosophical, even theological issues.Setting aside Awake\'s bizarre premise, though, it\'s essentially a crime procedural, potentially plagued with all the perils that genre comes with. Murder is part and parcel, and gore and violence can take center stage in any given episode. Language can be rough. And sex (between Michael and his wife) showed up as early as the very first episode. Also, Awake\'s whole ethos seems to bridle against authority: Rex, we learn, kept secrets from both his parents, and he struggles with his father\'s authority. Michael, similarly, pushes against his bosses. We\'ll see going forward whether it\'s with good reason or not.Episode ReviewsMarch 8, 2012TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tv14"The Little Guy" Michael tries to find out who murdered Bernard McKinzey: In the green world, he\'s a fertility doctor; in the red one he\'s homeless. (We see his corpse in both; in one it\'s surrounded by a pool of blood.) Part of the plot revolves around Bernard substituting his own sperm for those of donors, meaning he\'s likely fathered dozens, perhaps hundreds of children—including his murderer.Meanwhile, Michael learns that Rex was/is secretly refurbishing a motorcycle, even though both he and Hannah forbade it. Rex tells his best friend that he\'s hoping to sneak off to a music festival—perhaps in part to spend time with his girlfriend. Hannah says her son\'s disobedience makes her feel curiously proud. Michael lets Rex know he knows by telling him to wear a helmet. We see Michael make efforts to bond with his son. They eat together, for instance. But even when it comes to food, we see Rex brushing his dad off. A fertility doctor mentions that religious groups protest their work. Characters say "h‑‑‑," "d‑‑n" and "a‑‑" once apiece and misuse God\'s name two or three times.',crime
'monk','MonkAdrian Monk is a brilliant detective who, despite being burdened by obsessive-compulsive disorder and a host of crippling phobias, solves a baffling crime pretty much every week. With aid from his faithful and patient assistant, Natalie, Monk battles his own neuroses to help the San Francisco police department bring killers to justice and maybe—just maybe—heal a bit from the death of his beloved wife, Trudy. Episode ReviewsFebruary 20, 2009TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tvpg"Mr. Monk Fights City Hall"Mr. Monk doesn’t seem like much of a civic crusader. But when the city of San Francisco decides to tear down a parking garage, he goes all "Earth First" on it and chains himself to one of the garage’s concrete pillars. Trudy has to have something to do with this, fans had to be thinking. And sure enough, Monk tells a city councilwoman that his wife died in the garage oh-so-many years ago."You just stopped a children’s playground from being built and saved … a parking garage," Natalie says."So the system works!" Monk shouts.But when the councilwoman disappears and is later found bobbing in the San Francisco harbor, Monk has dual dilemmas on his hands: One, he has to help the police find the killer. Two, he has to persuade the councilwoman’s ditzy assistant to take her place in the council meeting and vote to save the garage. Since 2002, USA’s Emmy-winning show Monk has been one of television’s most reliable forms of comfort food. More Agatha Christie than CSI, the whodunit takes on a stand-alone murder mystery nearly every episode, and even in this, season seven’s grand finale, Monk doesn’t stray far from formula. As Monk says, the system works.But the show feels gentler than it actually is. And since that may not make complete sense, I’ll elaborate: A scene featuring the councilwoman’s body floating in the bay isn’t for young or squeamish eyes. Nor is the fact that, while alive, the woman apparently set up a "love nest" with her lover. It’s equipped with incense, French maids outfits and a drawer containing something so shocking (it’s never identified) that Natalie tells Monk to "never, never, never, never, never" open it. It’s suggested that the councilwoman—when she first goes missing—disappeared into some of the city’s mysterious hot dog "meat." And the episode’s language is flecked with mild profanities, abuses of God’s name and questionable euphemisms for Jesus’ name.',crime
'true_detective','True DetectiveThere is a darkness on the Louisiana bayou. Women and children disappear, leaving jagged stick sculptures behind. Lives are ruined, souls are devoured. And to make it stop, Detectives Rust Cohle and Marty Hart walk to the edge of sanity and beyond. True Detective\'s tagline is "Man is the cruelest animal." And the series may be television\'s cruelest show.The HBO program, which in its first season boasts longtime movie star Woody Harrelson and newly minted Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey, is a brooding work of prickly horror. The title stems from the pulp crime fiction of the early 20th century, particularly the periodical True Detective. (HBO says that each season will feature a new plot with new characters and actors.) For at least this first season, the plot is also steeped in weird, spiritual terror.For Rust and Marty, the case began as a simple murder investigation. It was triggered by the death of a prostitute found positioned as if praying to a tree, her head crowned with deer antlers. But then they uncover what could be a truly horrific cult—one that ritualistically demands the rape and murder of women and children—and a grand cover-up by politicians, police and even the clergy. We learn about child molestations at church camps and demons in masks. We hear references to the Yellow King and a green-eared "spaghetti monster." We drown in the darkest recesses of the flawed mortal soul. And because much of the story is told in flashback, we see the toll it has taken on the spirits of our protagonists as well. If viewers think they can turn to a couple of heroes in Rust and Marty, they are robbed of that too. Yes, the detectives want to bring these monsters to justice. And yet they, in their own way, are beasts as well—victims and servants of their own uncontrolled hungers and predilections. Both drink constantly. Rust does copious amounts of drugs. Marty—a man who claims to adhere to law and morality—has an affair. Rust has sex with Marty\'s wife. They\'re willing to torture and kill to bring the 17-year-old case to a close. And the nihilistic Rust believes it may be the last thing of value he ever does, suggesting that once they\'re done, he\'ll kill himself.Series creator and scriptwriter Nic Pizzolatto says the unremitting darkness of True Detective hides slivers of light. Of self-destructive Rust, Pizzolatto tells The Wall Street Journal that "He\'s too passionate, too acutely sensitive, and he cares too much to be labeled a successful nihilist. And in his monologues, don\'t we detect a whiff of desperation akin to someone who protests too much?" And though True Detective seems determined to drag itself and its audience into a world of nightmares, he cautions that the show\'s "agenda" will not be clear until the final episode. But as well-constructed as this series may be, and as many cards as it chooses to hold close, it\'s hard to believe that any payoff could be worth this twisted and terrible ride. In one episode, Marty tells Rust why he left the police force. During a case, he discovered that a disturbed mother had tried to dry off her infant in a microwave oven. We watch as he opens the oven and stares, aghast. Sick. "I didn\'t want to look at anything like that anymore," he says.We might well say the same thing.Episode ReviewsMarch 2, 2014TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tvma"After You\'re Gone" Marty watches a videotape of a young girl who is blindfolded and tied down by the cult disciples. The implication is that she\'s raped. He and Rust interview a cross-dressing male hooker in a gay bar (where we see homosexual couples kiss). He recounts how he was molested at a church camp when he was a child—an act probably linked to an occult ceremony. (Someone who seems to know something about such ceremonies fondly touches drawings of eerie stick constructions and mysteriously says, "Death is not the end. Rejoice.") Rust seems suicidal. And we hear about other acts of violence. Guns are pointed. Rust threatens to torture somebody with a car battery and jumper cables. Rust steals evidence. He and Marty drink beer and whiskey. Rust smokes and admits to Marty that he spent most of the last decade "stoned and drunk." (He now works as a bartender.) We hear the f-word more than 20 times, the s-word at least eight. Also: "p‑‑‑," "h‑‑‑" and "a‑‑." Jesus\' name is abused three or four times, and God\'s is paired with "d‑‑n" about the same. Crude references are made to oral sex. ',crime
'24','24Jack Bauer never seems to have a boring day. Whenever we see the fellow, he\'s always busy saving the world from terrorists, assassins, nerve gas, nuclear weapons, electronic sabotage and static cling—from dawn to dusk to dawn again. The bad guys change from day to day (season to season), but the action remains the same: Jack slogging his way from gunfight to gunfight, car chase to car chase, without so much as a Twinkie to keep him going. Bathroom breaks? Jack says they\'re for wimps."He\'s never won," Kiefer Sutherland, who plays Jack, told tv.ign.com. "Not one year has he ever walked out with his goal being accomplished, but he\'s a guy who\'s gonna give everything he can and try as hard as he can." And he does it in the face of gut-wrenching loss, staggering treachery and a mountain of red tape. He\'s a Wild West gunfighter in a 21st-century ethos, battling not just the black hats, but bureaucracy, politics and postmodern sensitivities, too. Put that in your TV juicer and squeeze.All of this goes a long way toward explaining the enduring appeal of America\'s most tortured tormentor, a guy who sacrifices everything to save the day—along with his own humanity.The show has its merits. It\'s an undeniable thrill-ride with unexpected nuance. Jack is, in some ways, a heroic champion. Some Christians have even labeled the Counter Terrorism Unit operative a Christ-like figure.But he\'s also killed his supervisor, shot an innocent woman in the leg and bit out a terrorist\'s jugular. Not exactly Christ-like material. He\'s forced medical personnel to revive a nearly dead man so he could whisper unspeakable threats in his ear. Then, when the man falls senseless again, Jack cuts open his chest (blood spurting and smearing) to retrieve a buried data chip.24 has other problems, too. Expletives fly right alongside the bullets. And never mind its one-day-equals-one-season structure, the series fills in gaps with an office soap opera—complete with casual kisses and forbidden affairs. But 24\'s most cutting sin is its headlong embrace of murder, torture and gore to advance its plot points. And it\'s not just the guilty who pay.Episode ReviewsMay 10, 2010TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tv14"12:00 p.m.-1:00 p.m." As 24 nears its series finale, it\'s readying its most gruesome moments. Indeed, this episode may well be the most brutally violent in the show\'s entire run. And, as always, it\'s made worse by the fact that Jack\'s the one who\'s responsible.After point-blank executing a woman in the minutes leading up to this hour, Jack—admitting that he\'s driven more by rage and revenge than his typical quest for justice—takes a pliers to the man who shot his lover. Then his fists. Then a knife. Then acid. Then a blowtorch. The camera spares us little of the gory detail. And before it\'s over, Jack has disemboweled the man to remove a cell phone SIM card from his stomach. (We don\'t see every detail of that.)Jack has always prized results over process—even when process is translated to mean basic humanity and morality. The onscreen result are images that are truly awful. It\'s shocking, even in 2010, that they\'re included in any story at all, much less that they\'re proffered on TV during prime time in a series that\'s celebrated by so many.February 15, 2010TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tv14"11:00 p.m.-12:00 a.m." Captured and tortured by Russian terrorists, Jack escapes by jamming a live jumper cable into his tormentor\'s chest with his feet, then breaking the guy\'s neck. CTU tech Dana Walsh, blackmailed by a pair of petty thieves, decides to sever her connection with them once and for all—keeping her fiancé in the dark about her sordid past.Around her swirls 24\'s standard spiral of violence: Jack\'s torturer shocks him several times with the jumper cables and also shoves one of his fingers into a bloody open wound in Jack\'s side. The indestructible CTU agent also gets grazed by buckshot. He mows down four people with guns, knives and his bare hands. Characters blurt out "h‑‑‑" a half-dozen times, "d‑‑n" once and misuse God\'s name once. Dana\'s nemeses loiter at a strip club where, among other related things (both sexual and alcoholic in nature), the camera briefly catches the side of a dancer\'s bare breast. References are made to infidelity.In a montage of clips from previous episodes, we see a policeman beaten with a baseball bat and Renee stabbing a Russian mobster to death.',crime
'csi','CSI: Crime Scene InvestigationCSI has been cutting up corpses and catching criminals in Las Vegas since the turn of the century. You\'d think that, after nearly a dozen years on the job, there\'d be just one last mystery to solve: Is there anyone left in the county to kill?Why, of course there is—as long as ratings for CBS\' landmark show hold up.CSI is the template on which most of the network\'s prime-time lineup (including two CSI spin-offs) is built: A group of likeable but serious-minded law enforcement types solve a crime in 44 minutes, not counting commercial breaks. Want complex characters, nuanced writing or addictive, serialized storylines? Go buy Lost DVDs. You won\'t find that stuff here.Sure, these characters have lives outside of work … but we see precious little of them onscreen. The star of CSI is its gory simplicity: Find body. Dissect body. Solve crime. Repeat. It is, in some respects, a throwback to older by-the-book cop shows such as Dragnet. And the premise has been so durable that the show survived the replacement of leading man William Petersen (who played Gil Grissom) with Laurence Fishburne (as Dr. Raymond Langston) in 2009.CSI has become, for many Americans, the television equivalent of comfort food—a way to spend time thinking about other people\'s problems instead of their own. CSI gives viewers something they crave: solution and resolution to a prickly problem. The characters find a way to make sense of the problems they face—unlike most of us, who often grapple with questions that don\'t seem to have easily available answers. CSI scratches the same itch that Sherlock Holmes did a century and a half ago: It suggests that every question has an answer if you look hard enough to find it.But if the show has a retro feel in some respects, it also illustrates how much the television landscape has changed. Bloody crime scenes are filmed in almost loving detail. Flashbacks to the moment of murder are regular and visceral staples. Characters and, by extension, viewers spend lots of time watching autopsies. And while forensics-centric shows like Quincy, M.E. allowed the camera to avert its all-knowing eye from each incision, CSI\'s cameramen never turn away, not even to blink.While many Americans are deeply troubled by the level of sex on TV, CSI\'s blood-and-gore quotient tickles R-rated territory—and rarely does anyone even raise an eyebrow. Episode ReviewsNovember 11, 2010TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tvpg"Fracked" After stripping off her clothes, a girl removes her bra to swim in a pond. (We see her bare back.) Soon afterwards, a touch from a floating corpse\'s hand makes her think her male companions are trying to grope her. While the murderer is eventually killed—run down by a passing truck while changing a tire—the CSI team believes a natural gas-drilling outfit may be the real culprit since, by extracting gas from shale through a process known as "fracking," the company is poisoning the town\'s water supply.During an autopsy, a man\'s body lies on the table, the top of the head cut off (flaps of skin cover the face, and forensics specialist Dr. Robbins picks up the missing part of the skull), the abdomen split open and innards piled up in bowls. Robbins reaches into the corpse\'s neck and pulls out the larynx, then draws (via syringe) fluid lodged inside. Later, he examines a maggot-encrusted goat\'s head: He saws the top of the skull off to better examine the brain. In flashback, we see men killed—one thunked on the head and left to drown, another shot twice. (We see blood fleck from the man\'s chest after the first shot and part of his skull lodge in the pavement with the second.) Dialogue features a handful of each of these swear words: "h‑‑‑," a‑‑." There\'s one use of "b‑‑tard."',crime
'bones','BonesStock skeleton warning: The content in Bones, as with most procedurals, can vary widely from week to week. What you saw last week isn\'t necessarily what you\'ll see to-marrow.Dr. Temperance Brennan is a brilliant, attractive forensic anthropologist skilled at reading bones and other human remains. Dealing with living, breathing people, however, tends to give the good doctor a headache. While she\'s softened a bit since she had a baby with former Army sniper-turned-FBI agent Seeley Booth—forming a formidable partnership both on and off the clock—"Bones" is still most comfortable in the world of fibulas and metatarsals. And her cohorts at the Jefferson Institute wouldn\'t have it any other way. Together, they make up a Washington, D.C., forensic team to die for—and somebody always seems to be doing just that.Based on the best-selling books by Kathy Reichs, Bones is all about cadavers and conundrums that demand lab work, footwork and at least a little teamwork. But along with scientific insight and superhero-smart solutions, parts of this hour-long show challenge our ability to suspend disbelief. For one thing, wunderkind Dr. Brennan is also a best-selling mystery novelist, a black belt in martial arts and a crack shot with a handgun. Given a little provocation, the socially shy PhD will borrow moves from Chuck Norris or Clint Eastwood, and somehow the authorities let her get away with it.Spiritual themes rise to the surface more often than they do on, say, CBS\' CSI shows, with Booth (a Catholic) and Bones (an atheist) regularly bumping heads. But the result never strays too far from "approved for mainstream TV" territory, which is to say it\'s not designed to reinforce Christian faith or ideals. Bones reaches out for viewers with well-developed characters and smartly written dialogue, especially for its leads, who bring to mind opposites-attract duos from The X-Files, Moonlighting and Cheers. But the real "draw" here are close-ups of people digging through decaying tissue, corpses being stripped by flesh-eating beetles, and a frozen pig getting tossed into a wood chipper, among many, many other things. While the show may feel in some ways "lighter" than some of its procedural pals over on CBS, the camera\'s certainly not shy about showing us all things dead."Eight o\'clock seems too early for a show featuring long, loving shots of desiccated corpses, but network TV doesn\'t abide by many genteel rules or good manners anymore," said Washington Post TV critic Tom Shales. "Even adults may feel the director is way too generous with views of rotting remains." Episode ReviewsApril 30, 2012TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tv14"The Family and the Feud" Bones and Booth investigate the death of a six-toed man in rural West Virginia. When they learn that the victim was a major player in a Hatfield/McCoy-like feud, suspicion naturally falls on the other family. Meanwhile, Bones struggles with leaving her infant daughter in the care of Max, Bones\' father who deserted her when she was little.We get some nice messages about family, reconciliation and giving people second chances here. But we also frequently see a grotesque, decaying corpse. Doctors remove a shoe (pulling off a bit of skin as they do so) to reveal a nausea-inducing foot. A man shoots at Bones and Booth; when Booth grabs the weapon from the guy, the attacker hits him in the face. Booth whaps the aggressor with the rifle butt. We hear about how, in the old days, the feuding parties "used to just kill each other and call it a day." Now they "just" file nuisance lawsuits. Couples kiss. Young lovers from rival families meet in the woods; their activities are referred to by Booth as "getting it on." Without going too far down the path Deliverance went, thankfully, we hear a man refer to his truffle-sniffing pig as a "sexy beast." Characters unearth "h‑‑‑" three or four times, and "b‑‑ch," "a‑‑," "d‑‑n" and "b‑‑tard" once each. ',crime
'alcatraz','Alcatraz"On March 21, 1963, Alcatraz officially closed. All the prisoners were transferred off the island. Only that\'s not what happened. Not at all." That\'s what actor Sam Neill solemnly says in commercials and during the opening of Fox\'s Alcatraz.So what, exactly, did happen? If creator J.J. Abrams has his way, we might not know for several seasons.Abrams, the man behind ABC\'s landmark serial Lost, has something perhaps even stranger on his hands with Alcatraz—a mash-up of an episodic police procedural and a serialized sci-fi time-bender. The prison\'s last residents (more than 300) apparently just … disappeared—not through tunnels painstakingly dug with fingernail clippings, or on handy-dandy escape boats found mysteriously anchored on the shoreline. No, the prisoners just vanished—a public relations disaster for law enforcement if ever there was one. No wonder the concocted story that the inmates were transferred became the official record. The government simply couldn\'t tell people that the country\'s most notorious criminals up and—well, left somehow. But now they\'re reappearing, and they\'re not just loitering in their old cells, waving to the tourists. These hardened convicts haven\'t aged a day in 50 years; they\'re still in their law-breaking prime, and they pick up right where they left off before they were arrested. Who\'s going to round the baddies up? Fox Mulder and Dana Scully would be naturals for this sort of thing, but they\'ve not been seen on the network for years. So the job falls to FBI agent Emerson Hauser (played by Neill), who was at the Alcatraz docks when the criminals vanished and has been secretly preparing for them to return ever since. He\'s joined by Rebecca Madsen, a rough-and-tumble homicide detective, and Diego "Doc" Soto, noted author, Alcatraz expert, lovable geek … and refugee from Lost. Their adventures in time and prison space are dark ones. They bravely battle against some truly horrible people. And grim violence here is a given. Nightmares are optional, but certainly possible.Episode ReviewsJanuary 23, 2012TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tv14"Kit Nelson" Kit Nelson was imprisoned for killing children. And hours after zapping into our time, he kidnaps an 11-year-old boy. The team has 48 hours to get the child back alive.We see flashbacks of the killer in Alcatraz, where he was despised among even the hardened criminals there. They beat him almost to death, and we see his horribly mangled face. It\'s easy to infer an allusion to homosexuality and pedophilia in an inmate\'s conversation with Kit. But Kit\'s issues with children don\'t stem from sexual desire, we learn. He killed his 11-year-old brother when he himself was still a child, and we hear a graphic depiction of what the strangulation looked and felt like from Kit\'s point of view. He proceeds to painstakingly re-create the crime with his other victims. We learn that Doc was also abducted at age 11. Someone is shot. Others are threatened. Kit forces his newest victim to jump into a lake and holds him under water. He gets angry whenever the boy doesn\'t follow directions precisely. Hauser pushes over a desk. Someone talks about an enviable job being a "wet dream." God\'s name is casually interjected a half-dozen times. We hear "h‑‑‑" and "d‑‑n."',crime
'castle','CastleYou\'d think fiction writers would spend most of their time sitting around … writing. Not Richard Castle. He\'s too busy leading a life of semi-comedic glamour and gritty adventure. He has his reasons, of course. In order to shake off a wicked case of writer\'s block, he\'s finagled his way into an informal partnership with beautiful New York City detective Kate Beckett. He\'s researching his next book, he says. But really he\'s fighting crime while bantering with his clever teenage daughter and schmoozing on the book-signing and talk show circuits. It\'s practically a given that Castle and Beckett will eventually become romantically (and perhaps physically) entwined. But for now, the two settle for exchanging snide comments and charging up the onscreen chemistry meter. Oh, and they solve a new crime each week, too.Is it, as Castle says, a "whole new chapter in crime fighting?" Well, no. We\'ve seen variations on this theme for the last 30 or so years, from Hart to Hart and Moonlighting to The X-Files. And while Castle is somewhat less offensive than various other crime-based television programs, it still has its share of problems. The banter can be suggestive, sometimes tawdry. Profanity can be an issue too.Episode ReviewsDecember 5, 2011TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tvpgCastle and Beckett find themselves handcuffed together and trapped in an über-creepy cellar. A freezer full of bloodstained knives and chains, and a truck smeared with hair and blood make it look as if they\'ve stumbled into a Saw sequel. But true to Castle\'s more lighthearted ethos, the nightmarish scenario winds up being an exotic animal-smuggling operation—the blood and the knives simply the tools and remnants of the animals\' mealtimes. In the process, though, the pair nearly become tiger dinner themselves. And we do briefly see a dead body, both in person and in photos: The corpse isn\'t bloody, but we see that the man\'s fingertips have been burned. Guns are pointed.Castle makes suggestive quips related to the cuffs and to the couples\' forced proximity. While trying to escape, the two contort into uncomfortable positions, including one that mimics a sex act. Castle lifts up Beckett\'s shirt (to examine a needle mark on her back). There\'s a reference to drug use. "H‑‑‑" pop out more than a half-dozen times, along with "d‑‑n," "a‑‑" and a few misuses of God\'s name.April 19, 2010TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tvpg"Den of Thieves" Castle and Beckett attempt to solve a murder that was, apparently, committed by a dead man. Turns out, the guy who supposedly did it is still alive and he\'s a one-time detective who\'s working freelance to bust a notorious crime boss—to clear his own sullied name. That\'s OK, we\'d say. But to tie things up by episode\'s end, the "good guys" break into a bad guy\'s office, steal stuff and lie to pretty much everyone.We see a burnt and bloody corpse duct-taped inside a car with jumper cables attached to the body. Beckett and Castle believe the man died during a torture session gone awry. Beckett and another detective spar with each other in the gym—a sporting contest both mildly violent and sexually charged (when they pin each other to the gym mats). Castle teaches his daughter to play poker, and the two of them "win" such things as new sunglasses and exemptions from doing dishes and making beds. Characters misuse God\'s name, as well as "h‑‑‑," "d‑‑n," "b‑‑tard" and the initials "BS."April 12, 2010TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tvpg"The Late Shaft" A late-night talk show host dies from a heart attack that turns out to be murder. Who did it? That\'s what Castle wants to uncover—but only between romps under the covers with a beautiful young actress.Castle and said actress lustily grapple with each other twice ("Gotta get some new shirts," he says as she rips another one off his torso) and lounge around in revealing clothes (he\'s shirtless, she\'s in lingerie). The actress, naturally, is just using Castle. We learn she\'s simultaneously sleeping with a network exec to land a part in a sitcom. But Castle doesn\'t seem to mind too much. After the ruse is revealed, he and the actress part as friends: "I\'ve never had so much fun being used," he tells her. Along with the words "b‑‑ch," "h‑‑‑", "d‑‑n" and "a‑‑," we hear jokes about marriage and fidelity and references to sex and something called "booty roulette." A lewd, rather explicit one-liner flies at Tiger Woods\' expense. It\'s discovered that the talk show host is having an affair with an intern a third his age. Referring to a fancy sports car, somebody blurts out "holy shift." We see a corpse on an autopsy table.',crime
'closer','The CloserIt\'s the twang you notice first.Each word that falls from Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson\'s mouth holds hints of Georgia. Every syllable seems scented with magnolias and potluck suppers. Her voice softens her physical angularity and turns her from intimidator to intimate. As she plays confessor to Los Angeles\' crooks and killers, and dorm mom to her all-male team of detectives, her twang makes her feel somehow … genuine.Which, when you think about it, may be The Closer\'s oddest irony. Because Deputy Chief Johnson is one of television\'s most duplicitous characters. She lies, cajoles and cheats to get possible perpetrators to confess. And she\'ll walk to the edge of legality—and dangle her foot over it—to try to make L.A.\'s streets safer.This closer is a poser.If we\'ve learned anything from the last decade of television, it\'s that America loves crime procedurals. And, for the most part, The Closer follows the genre\'s playbook point by point. Every week in this telegenic la-la land, someone dies who shouldn\'t. Every week, Brenda and L.A.\'s Major Crimes Unit sift through evidence, witnesses and suspects to find out who did it and why.But what sets The Closer apart from CSI and NCIS is its titular character, hired away from Atlanta for her ability to get criminals to hack up confessions."Murder is the only crime I care about today," Brenda tells a pair of auto thieves. And when the thieves tell her that the dead guy might\'ve been killed by a stray bullet from one of their would-be carjack victims (who fired warning shots in the air to safeguard his Cadillac), Brenda seems ever-so-sympathetic."I completely understand," she tells them as they unwittingly write out detailed confessions for attempted robbery and, because they feloniously triggered the chain of events that led to the accidental death, murder.Brenda is the show\'s moral core—but she\'s often an "end justifies the means" sort. Not that we\'re asked to embrace everything she and her squad of detectives do, mind you. As the series has worn on, we\'ve seen some of the unit\'s questionable decisions come to haunt them all. In The Closer\'s seventh and final season, Johnson and her team are under more scrutiny than ever—fallout for some questionable decisions made in a case the previous season. The result of these moral quandaries, as far as viewers are concerned, is one part escapism and two parts thinkism, meaning the show takes serious issues, lightens them up a bit, then encourages us to … ponder. In one episode, Brenda and crew must investigate the torture and death of a murderer, inviting us to mull vigilantism. In another, the Major Crimes Unit explores the seemingly senseless death of a neighborhood "saint"—a reformed gang member who was working at a local parish before he was killed—and in so doing asks us to think about where God might be in the midst of random horror.A quirky, self-deprecating levity is smoothed onto the top of those deep thoughts, and that sometimes gets in their way. But a bigger roadblock here is the fact that TV shows seem to all want to be PG-13 (some of them R) movies these days. Brenda, in the hands of Kyra Sedgwick, is curiously old-fashioned. Her movements and dialogue at even crime scenes give her an air of authoritative gentility. She\'s not known for her swearing, which in our context is a good thing. But the criminals who surround her—and the rest of her squad, for that matter—aren\'t quite so courteous. The s-word sometimes makes an appearance, as well as "a‑‑hole," "d‑‑n" and "b‑‑ch." God\'s name is habitually battered.Rarely do the murders happen onscreen, but the aftermath often makes the cut: bloody holes in foreheads, bruised and lacerated limbs. When we don\'t see the fallout, we\'re sure to still hear quite a bit about it, descriptions proffered with cold, graphic precision.Series writers seem to shy away from sex scenes. But sexual content is common, from investigating the murder of a minor celebrity who built a cable show around the documentation of his one-night stands, to strategic salacious pictures, to detectives detailing their sex lives.The police are the good guys here, no questions asked. It\'s the world they inhabit—and the worldview they accept—that are the perps.Episode ReviewsAugust 6, 2012TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tv14"Armed Response" The unit investigates the death of a security guard—a war hero who had his face blown away by a shotgun. We see the man\'s dead body as well as blood and gore on the asphalt. Multiple crime shots of the body pop up throughout the episode.As the investigation wears on, suspicion falls on a young man and his 16-year-old girlfriend. The guard apparently kicked them out of an empty house, which is strewn with the detritus of their relationship, including condoms (used and unused), marijuana (which he allegedly had a prescription for) and the girl\'s bra. The young woman lies to protect her boyfriend, saying that a "big black man" on a motorcycle was talking with the guard shortly after the guard kicked them out of the house. Brenda eventually tracks the shotgun used in the murder to the girl\'s father, who admits to killing the guard after his daughter told him that the guard tried to rape her (another lie). "He made her strip and tried to mount her," the father believes. Both he and his daughter are accused of the murder.People talk about pot and beer. Detectives contemplate bodily fluids. One officer learns that the woman he\'s living and sleeping with was a "leak," giving the secrets he\'d share with her to an outside source. We also learn that the detective and the leak met at his church. Characters say "b‑‑ch," "d‑‑n," "a‑‑," "h‑‑‑" and misuse God\'s name twice.July 25, 2011TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tvpg"To Serve With Love" Detectives Provenza and Flynn, with help from computer expert Buzz, take on an unapproved freelance gig to serve court papers to a felon wanted by the FBI. When Buzz asks if what they\'re doing is legal, Flynn says, "We\'re law enforcement and we\'re doing it. That makes it legal." Then, moments after they serve the guy, he\'s gunned down and dropped out a 14th-story window—onto Buzz\'s Prius. (We see bloody bullet holes in the victim\'s back and a trickle of blood from his ear.) Turns out, the dead man was only an actor. And Brenda suspends Provenza, Flynn and Buzz for 72 hours for taking on the illicit job. But she, of course, is just as bad as they were: Their suspension allows her to use them—as temporary civilians—to track down the felon for real, stringing along the FBI in the meantime.Provenza and Flynn laudably turn down a bribe. But they break or bend the law several times in the space surrounding that one good decision. Brenda lies to the felon\'s family members, misleads other police officers and misdirects the FBI. A man\'s lack of circumcision becomes a big clue. Characters say "d‑‑n," "h‑‑‑," "b‑‑ch," "b‑‑tard" and misuse God\'s name. ',crime
'the_americans','The AmericansIf there\'s one thing television teaches us, it\'s to never, ever trust our neighbors. Sure, the Bible tells us to treat them kindly and all. And television agrees—but only to keep them from murdering us in our sleep. After all, if you lived back in the early 1980s on a block owned by FX, they just might be deep-cover Russian spies.Meet the Jennings family of The Americans. Philip and Elizabeth run a travel agency. (They still had such things back then.) Daughter Paige likes to shop at the newfangled mall in town. Son Henry loves playing backyard hockey. These all-Americans look like they crawled right out of a Hallmark Channel special (if Hallmark had had a cable channel during the Cold War.) But the Jennings are Russians, sent by the Soviet Union to spy on all things U.S. They groom sources. They take pictures. They either have sex with or kill anyone who might know anything. Then they ship whatever they can back to the Motherland. James Bond is not their template here, though. Because even as they spy for the Soviet Union, they\'re just trying to live their lives, too—raise their kids in the best way they know how. When Philip and Elizabeth stay awake with worry, it\'s more often because of their children, not their super-secret occupations. What mother wouldn\'t worry about her darling daughter? What father wouldn\'t fret about how best to deal with his headstrong boy? And then, because neither child knows what Mom and Dad really do for a living, they have another worry: What if they\'re caught? What becomes of their kids? Philip in particular seems conflicted over his duties as Soviet agent and his responsibilities as a husband and father. Frankly, there are times when he would much rather scrap the whole spy scene and defect. "We always conceived of The Americans as a show about a marriage, more than espionage, that shows how, even under the craziest circumstances, the marriage still looks and feels like any other marriage," Joseph Weisberg, the show\'s creator (and a former CIA employee) told Time. "I think Matthew Rhys [as Philip] is this incredible embodiment of a suburban dad and a tough KGB officer at the same time. Keri Russell [as Elizabeth] can be such a loving mom who can turn, on a dime, into this killer."Indeed she can. And does. She and Philip can also quickly and easily scrap their wedding vows to use sex as a weapon of war against someone else with valuable information to share. Thus, both Philip and Elizabeth sleep around a lot—with some of the scenes shown in extreme, embarrassing, titillating detail. From flashes of nudity to explicit sexual movements, FX makes full use of the show\'s TV-MA rating.The violence, too, is routinely extreme—more harrowing, perhaps, than perspicuous. These are spies, remember, who must do their work in secret. Rarely do we see showy spouts of blood. But the callous brutality with which they go about their work and dispose of the aftermath—well, let\'s just say that even Dexter might wince. Language is often harsh, with characters prone to saying the s-word or abusing Jesus\' name.There\'s one more detail to deal with here: the enemy. It may seem quaint now, but this being a period piece, it\'s relevant to remember that in the 1980s many in the Soviet Union wanted to bring down the United States and all it stood for. Philip and Elizabeth Jennings would\'ve been significant tools in their arsenal."One paradigm I have is that the audience sympathizes with Philip and Elizabeth, follows them along as they are on some dangerous and scary mission and wants them to succeed," Weisberg said. "And then the audience suddenly gasps, \'Oh my God, I was just rooting for them while they were carrying out this terrible thing that was devastating the U.S. government!\' There\'s this moment of shock because they\'ve been rooting against our own interest. Then before you know it, Philip and Elizabeth are back at home with their nice kids, and the audience is on their side again. Through that experience, there\'s a breakdown of the barriers between us and them. Finding yourself rooting for the enemy is a fundamental part of the experience. What is the enemy? What does it even mean to be the enemy?"It\'s actually a pretty profound question. And the answers to it make a huge difference in how one sees the world. But do we need such a salacious show to do the asking?If there\'s one thing television teaches us, it\'s to never, ever trust your neighbors. But The Americans tells us that trusting our televisions can be just as dangerous. Episode ReviewsFebruary 4, 2015TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tvma"Baggage" Paige is growing increasingly aware of politics, and Elizabeth wonders whether she might take to the family business. Philip, knowing what\'s involved with the job, is horrified. And it seems he\'s right to feel that way, because we soon see Elizabeth help dispose of a woman murdered by one of their associates. The woman was killed while having sex and is fully nude. We see her from the rear and side, and we see her body grotesquely folded into a suitcase, arms and legs snapping as it\'s compacted. The damage done is evidenced by, among other things, shattered bones pressing against skin.Stan is nearly shot by a Soviet agent and tells his ex-wife about it. "Truth is," he says, nearly sobbing, "You are the only person I want to tell." She says she\'s glad he\'s all right, but that she\'s not coming back to him. Paige and her mom talk about whether Dad is having an affair. (Paige thinks he might be; Mom knows he\'s not.)A woman is shown urinating, then wiping herself. Philip and Elizabeth drink beers at a bar. Characters say "g--d--n" three times and "d--n" once.April 16, 2014TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tvma"New Car" In the midst of much plotting and counterplotting, Philip buys a shiny new Camero and brings it home to a displeased Elizabeth. "Don\'t you enjoy any of this?" he asks her by way of excuse, pointing to the house, her clothes, their posh American lifestyle. "That\'s not why I\'m here," she tells him. "It\'s nicer here, yes. It\'s easier. It\'s not better." Lucia, a KGB asset, tries to drug, kidnap and eventually kill Larrick, another (but more important and slimier) asset. They tussle and both get shot with tranquilizer darts. When Elizabeth shows up to settle things, Lucia makes another attempt on Larrick. Larrick strangles her to death in front of Elizabeth, who does nothing. Philip discovers he indirectly caused the death of 160 Soviets. We hear about plots to kill others. Philip, undercover, is seen in bed with another woman. An FBI agent breaks laws to save his Russian girlfriend, who in gratitude kisses him passionately while both sit on a bed. (It\'s implied that she\'s his lover and, further, not a faithful one.)We hear one s-word; also four or five uses of "g‑‑d‑‑n" and one "h‑‑‑." Folks drink liquor. There\'s talk of buying beer and of using alcohol to make sex palatable. Henry breaks into a neighbor\'s house to play video games.February 6, 2013TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tvma"The Clock" In order to plant a bug in the U.S. Secretary of State\'s private study, Phillip and Elizabeth blackmail the secretary\'s housekeeper by poisoning her son. In 72 hours, they tell her, her college-age boy will be dead unless she cooperates. The housekeeper, however, is deeply loyal to the family she serves, and very religious to boot. This prompts Phillip to say, "People who believe in God always make the worst targets." And sure enough, the housekeeper refuses to "help." "I know the devil," she tells Philip. "I don\'t listen to you. I listen to my Lord. He protects me. He guides me." With that, Phillip grabs a pillow and begins smothering her son right in front of her—keeping it up until she finally relents. Elsewhere, torture is used to get somebody to talk. (Something is stuffed down an informant\'s mouth and throat.) Elizabeth intimates that she\'d kill herself before getting caught. Phillip shares a graphic sex scene with a politician\'s trophy wife. It involves rear nudity, some roughness and sexual movements. We see the woman elsewhere in her bra and panties. She frequently kisses and poses dirty come-ons to Phillip. After the pilot focuses on a man crudely propositioning the 14-year-old Paige, it\'s notable that part of this episode revolves around her buying a bra and getting her ears pierced. (We see part of her bra strap.) Characters drink wine and beer. They say the s-word four or five times, and also say "a‑‑" and "d‑‑n," misuse both God\'s and Jesus\' names, and apply lots of vulgar terms to various body parts.',crime
'boardwalk_empire','Boardwalk EmpireThere\'s nothing like the seaside near Atlantic City—not for the harried New Yorkers who retreated to the beach in the 1920s and \'30s. It\'s as pretty as a postcard, this beach—the sand, the sky, the rolling waves. But the water here is dark, too, and cold. There might be anything underneath its surface: rocks, trash, fish, even crabs that might sink their hard pincers into soft flesh.Atlantic City itself is no different, really. Nor is its "emperor," Enoch Thompson. Enoch—Nucky to his friends—is one of the city\'s most beloved politicians, a Republican who cares for the locals and was once a staunch supporter of Prohibition. But he\'s also a crime lord, actively engaged in selling booze at a killer profit while killing anyone who might get in the way. Under his leadership, Atlantic City has become a haven for vice and debauchery. He ruthlessly rules over his boardwalk empire, holding it in a gloved hand soaked with liquor and blood. HBO\'s ambitious series Boardwalk Empire mixes fractious fiction with sordid fact—presenting an Atlantic City history filled with colorful and ruthless crime bosses most of us have heard of: Al Capone. Charles "Lucky" Luciano. Meyer Lansky. (Nucky is based on the real-life Enoch Johnson, who was eventually jailed on tax evasion charges in 1941.) Theirs is a world filled with three-piece suits and fedoras, illicit booze and drive-by hits. The pilot episode was directed by no less a filmmaking luminary than Martin Scorsese (at an estimated cost of $18 million). And the series has gone on to win 17 Emmys. But it has never been a pleasant walk down Park Place. It is, in fact, one of the most violent programs on television.With so many mobsters in play, you\'d expect a few to get offed, and so they do. They\'re ambushed and gunned down, blood pooling around their wound-riddled bodies. They\'re drowned. Stabbed. Chopped up. Crumpled and smashed. Rarely does HBO give us an episode in which everyone in it survives to the credits.Sexual sleaze surrounds these goons. In addition to bootlegging, Nucky has his hands in prostitution and gambling. Foul language includes unfiltered f-words.This is Atlantic City at its most debased—the original Sin City, if you will. If the seaside hot spot more resembled Martha\'s Vineyard, I doubt HBO would\'ve been much interested. I mean, really, what was the last original HBO program that wasn\'t interested in such debasement? Episode ReviewsSeptember 7, 2014TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tvma"Golden Days for Boys and Girls" Boardwalk Empire jumps ahead seven years (to 1931, the year Prohibition ended) for its fifth and final season. And it also flashes back to the 1800s when Nucky\'s just 12, trying to help his struggling family. "Be honest and true, boys, whatever you do, boys," is a line that runs through young Nucky\'s head. And he believed it—then. We\'re left to wonder what happened. In the 1930s again, Nucky plies a visiting senator with alcohol and prostitutes. He\'s attacked with a machete—prompting his bodyguard to bury the weapon in his attacker\'s head and cut off the guy\'s ear. Margaret\'s boss kills himself in front of his staff with a pistol. Other violence involves a riot, an escaped prisoner, a guard\'s head getting blown off with a shotgun, a muddy drowning, attacks with shovels, a poisoning and, of course, more shootings. Mobsters seal a deal with their own blood (cutting their hands). Young Nucky and a rival get into a fight, and his father slaps him across the face.Nearly everyone smokes and drinks. They use the f-word four times (in subtitled Italian), along with "b--ch," "h---" and "a--." God\'s name is misused, once with "d--n."',crime
'ncis','NCISAnother day, another badly disfigured corpse.Such is the work-a-week grind for the folks of NCIS, one of CBS\' many, wildly successful acronym-laden dramas. And the use of an acronym for a name (it stands for Naval Criminal Investigative Service) is oddly apropos: After all, these good military investigators spend their days wallowing in a veritable alphabet soup of crime and clues. Someone shows up on the GPS DOA bearing foreign DNA on her GAP jeans. But then the suspect, ID\'ed as a J, has an FTA, which brings in the FBI … Well, you get the idea.The NCIS team is led by longtime special agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs, a former marine hiding, perhaps, a big secret in his past. He, along with a bevy of clever investigators, take on the military\'s toughest crimes—most of them involving a dead person of some sort. Does the team, or the audience, mourn over these poor, dead souls? Not really. How could they? How could we? The "pros" we\'re watching take the job in ghoulish stride, smoothing over the blood and gore with a steady patter of wit and the occasional romantic entanglement. Besides, we meet a new corpse or two or 10 every week. So the calluses have built up pretty thick.Television has the curious ability to make the horrific humdrum. And NCIS is by now, to its legions of viewers, practically comfort food. (It was the highest-rated drama on television during the 2009-10 season.) Never mind, they say, about the mashed and mangled bodies. Never mind that Tony DiNozzo has been known to frequent strip clubs. Or that Gibbs isn\'t at all put off by the prospect of breaking rules if it\'ll help him crack a case. This is a competent, sometimes clever show that always promises a tidy resolution by the time the credits roll—and that\'s something we long for in our daily lives. All those pesky deadlines get buried, for an hour, underneath the fictional dead. Episode ReviewsApril 27, 2010TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tv14"Moonlighting" A murdered military man turns out to have likely witnessed a gangland hit. And corpses pile up like sandbags: One man dies from a bullet to the brain (we see the bloody hole in his forehead), another from drowning (his corpse is chained, and we see bruises and cuts). Both are shown with their chests gorily stitched together following autopsies. Another 10 people are killed in an onscreen explosion, and we see medical personnel trying to match charred chunks of human remains with one another. Two others were immolated. Timothy McGee boasts of killing 28,000 people in a video game. A technician cracks wise at the expense of dead folks. There\'s talk of sexual harassment and getting a "lap dance from a nun." A guy and his girlfriend are shown from the back with their shirts off. She\'s wearing a bra.',crime
'person_of_interest','Person of InterestThere\'s something suspicious about Santa Claus.Oh, sure, he seems nice and all—a right jolly old elf, really. But I\'m not sure if I like the idea of him watching me while I sleep, or knowing when I\'m awake, or somehow knowing if I\'ve been bad or good. It makes me wonder … is my dog a North Pole informant? Are my houseplants keeping notes on my movements? If St. Nick wasn\'t such a saint, and if he didn\'t live on a sheet of lawless international ice up north, I\'m sure his habits would stir a great deal of discussion about civil liberties.Which brings us, oddly, to Person of Interest. Because you can really think about this sci-fi drama\'s massive, information-gathering machine as a computerized Kris Kringle, or perhaps a binary Big Brother. It sees all, knows all and watches our every move—ostensibly for our own good. Makes you feel safe, doesn\'t it?We don\'t actually see much of the machine in question. Developed by brilliant billionaire Harold Finch, the computer is in the hands of the government. It\'s tasked with sifting through humongous piles of bits and bytes that make up modern-day society: our texts, our posts, our smiling visages when we take money out of the ATM. The machine\'s looking for terrorists, mostly. At least, that\'s what it\'s designed to do. But to find them, it\'s been told to sift through everyone else\'s stuff too, like a shopper burrowing through a tub of DVDs to find the last copy of Big Fish.So why let all that good, juicy info just go to waste? Why not secretly design the computer to search for non-terrorist but still criminal activity too? In fact, why not go after people who look like they might be involved in a crime? Hey! What if you could use the computer to stop murders before they\'re actually committed?Finch thought through all those things before he designed a back door into the computer\'s software, telling it to spit out a Social Security number every time it detects a murder about to take place. The number might belong to the victim. It might belong to the killer. Finch doesn\'t know. All he knows is that the person is involved somehow.But Finch isn\'t exactly a man of action. So he partners with a spook named John Reese, a former special ops military man and (perhaps) one-time assassin. "I don\'t like to kill," Reese tells a potential informant, "but I\'m very, very good at it." Thankfully, in this new gig, Reese is out to prevent murders, not commit them. So while we see that he could kill, he doesn\'t (or, at least, he doesn\'t very often). Not that that stops the dead bodies from piling up around him like dirty clothes around a hamper. Rarely does an episode of Person of Interest go fatality free. That makes violence one of the bigger content concerns on this show. Passing references to sexuality pop up as well, and language can be harsh. But in the end, it\'s the premise itself that poses the biggest quandary for discerning viewers. And it\'s not so much the Santa-impersonating computer that\'s at issue, either. After all, the machine\'s just doing what it\'s told. Rather, it\'s the questionable decisions made by the human beings privy to its digital output. Finch, you see, is using his creation illegally to thwart crimes before they happen. Reese is wanted by police himself, apparently in connection with several unsolved murders. And every mission involves breaking a slew of civil laws (through eavesdropping and wiretapping) and moral ones (through cheating, lying, stealing and potentially killing). So instead of turning itself into a deep rumination on the lines we draw between privacy and safety, Person of Interest ends up being more of a visceral salute to high-tech vigilantism. While the script sometimes asks probing questions, the answers the bad guys almost always get are complete dead-ends. So is that really the kind of thing that\'ll get you on Santa\'s "nice" list?',crime
'blue_bloods','Blue BloodsRandomly stick a pin into any TV lineup, and you\'re bound to hit a police drama. But not all cop shows are created equal. As compared to your average CSI, CBS\' Blue Bloods takes a more keep-it-in-the-family approach to police work by showing us the New York City police department through the eyes of Irish-American protagonists, the Reagans—cops one and all, through and through.Sitting in the police commissioner\'s chair during the week and at the head of the family table on Sundays is Frank Reagan, a craggy-faced, mustachioed patriarch who handles police emergencies and family strains with the same sort of resolve that\'s bolstered by time and experience. Son Danny is the rumpled and ever-stubbled detective on the front lines. Balancing out opposite ends of that dramatic family core is Frank\'s dad and retired police chief, Henry, who fondly remembers the kick-\'em-in-the-shorts, no-nonsense days of yore. Youngest sibling Jamie recently rejected a life of lawyering for the thankless job of beat cop. Add Frank\'s idealistic, assistant DA daughter, Erin, to the mix, and you\'ve got a cop\'s-eye view of things from just about every strata of the law-enforcement world.In CSI, the story is often preoccupied with the autopsy room, and episodes can be filled with graphic gore. And in other series, such as Law & Order: SVU, the crimes themselves can feel oppressively tawdry and, for some people, titillating. New waves of cop shows, from NBC\'s Hannibal to HBO\'s True Detective embrace deeply flawed antiheroes or darkly villainous primaries. All of these shows can make it feel like the world is full of bad, bad people. Blue Bloods, while never veering far from the constructs of the established genre, offers something of an antidote to that: Here we see regular ol\' people trying to do the proper thing. We see principled characters square off, showing that good people can sometimes disagree. And we see this family of Reagans trying to do right by the badges they wear and the city they protect. "Blue Bloods combines the classic American values of family, service, love and hard work," writes Dan Gainor, vice president of business and culture for the Media Research Center. "It\'s a cop drama that is in many ways reminiscent of Duck Dynasty even down to the family dinner. This is the kind of TV many Americans crave. As one of the stars said in a recent episode, the family\'s legacy is \'service.\' When his son tells how four generations of the family served in our nation\'s wars he says, \'I want to be just like him.\' That\'s celebrating the best of us." Clearly, this is a family that loves its literal law and order. And through the Reagans\' steadfast refusal to give up on one another, it\'s equally clear that this is a cop drama concerned more about the bonds of family then the bones of forensics.Blue Bloods is not without its problems, naturally. It is on TV, after all. Sometimes those "family values" we\'ve been talking about can actually rub the wrong way. (In a recent episode, one Reagan encourages her daughter to wait until she\'s in love to sleep with someone—not marriage.) Mild profanities filter into the script, too, and the criminal setups allow for depictions of violence as they run the gamut from child molesters to terrorist threats to cop killers. Episode ReviewsFebruary 28, 2014TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tv14"Open Secrets" Erin comes home to find her daughter, Nicky, and the girl\'s boyfriend already there—both adjusting their clothes. Erin doesn\'t say anything about the relationship until Nicky blurts out a few days later, "Why don\'t you just ask if I\'m having sex?!" So Erin does, and Nicky says no—but that they\'ve talked about it. Erin\'s response? That she trusts Nicky to make the right decision (confessing she herself was not a virgin when she married) but also saying that the two of them are not allowed in Nicky\'s bedroom anymore. (We later see the young couple kiss.)Danny and Maria investigate the disappearance of a 10-year-old girl, a case with similarities to one Danny worked seven years prior. And the father of the previous abductee tries to help. We\'re told that Danny encouraged him years ago to never lose hope, and "Now these parents need you to do the same for them," he says. (Danny ends up rescuing both girls, validating the father\'s hope for all these years.) Frank\'s antiterrorism unit comes under fire, with others demanding more transparency. He refuses. Information, he says, "is a lot less valuable if your enemies know you have it." But he finally agrees to a modicum of outside oversight. The family drinks wine around the dinner table. We hear people say "d‑‑n" (twice), "h‑‑‑" (four times) and "p‑‑‑ed." October 22, 2010TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tv14"What You See" Frank receives an emergency call from the FBI, informing him that a local named Khalid Hassan—formerly known as Steve Hass—is in custody. Seems this radical Islamic convert had some messages from al-Qaeda on his home computer—along with plans for a car-mounted explosive that could blow up a city block. Somewhere out there is an accomplice in a dark SUV. And the e-mails indicate an explosive deadline of 5 p.m. The hunt is on. At police headquarters, Frank wrestles with balancing public awareness with keeping the public from panicking. Danny is trying to get Khalid to talk, even as he tries unsuccessfully to connect with his wife and kids who are in the potential blast zone. Jamie is working a police blockade. And the SUV keeps moving ever closer to its target.The episode raises the questions: Is racial profiling acceptable? And how much freedom would you sacrifice for the public safety? The answers aren\'t obvious, but a familial prayer of thanks—over a meal of beer and pizza—caps the happy conclusion.',crime
'allegiance','AllegianceWhen we\'re kids, we often believe that our parents only exist for us. Oh, we know they may have outside jobs and interests and a curious love of broccoli at dinner. But for the most part, we figure they\'re simply around to take us to soccer practice and check our homework and make us eat broccoli. Then one day we realize that our parents are, like, real people—and come with a past that didn\'t include us at all. Suddenly we look at them almost like we\'re seeing them for the first time.A good thing, right? Well, sure, unless your parents just happen to be Russian secret agents. That can make for some awkward dinner conversation, let me tell you. More broccoli, anyone? In fairness, Katya O\'Connor would like to cut her ties with the Russian government. She served the Motherland long and well in her time with the KGB (now the SVR), but when she fell in love with one of her marks (named Mark, appropriately), she wanted out of the biz. When you\'re a spy, though, you don\'t turn in your two weeks\' notice and that\'s that. So Katya and Mark made a deal—a little more service for a chance to finally quit. It wasn\'t the best of bargains, certainly. Mark was made to betray his native America, and their eldest daughter, Natalie, wound up being a spy, too. But it seemed to work. Katya and Mark have been living pretty normal lives for a while, and they successfully kept their two other kids—aimless high schooler Sarah and the spectacularly gifted Alex—away from Russian interference.Or, they did until Alex started working for the CIA. Now, with the official family genius being an official U.S. spook, suddenly Moscow has renewed its interest in the O\'Connors.NBC\'s Allegiance takes the conceit of FX\'s The Americans and gives it what almost every broadcast drama needs to be greenlit these days: a freakishly smart, socially stunted protagonist. Alex fleshes out the formula well, spending his mornings looking flustered, his afternoons looking brilliant and his nights looking over power plant schematics (memorizing them instantly, of course). And even though the family-of-spies premise is kind of outlandish, this cloak-and-dagger drama will keep viewers chewing their fingernails without causing near the level of collateral damage The Americans does. Which is not to mean that Allegiance isn\'t jarringly, sometimes bloodily violent. It\'s just maybe a tad bit sneakier about how that kind of stuff gets shown.Episode ReviewsFebruary 5, 2015TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tv14"Pilot" A man is slowly fed, feet-first, into a power plant furnace and burned alive in the show\'s opening minutes. Flames engulf his legs as he screams. The gruesome scene inspires a Russian agent to defect, and it\'s Alex\'s analysis that convinces CIA bigwigs she\'s telling the truth. That draws the interest of SVR bigwigs, who renew contact with Katya and Mark and demand they turn their son into a Russian spy. They resist that order but agree to spy on Alex themselves—which will, they say, accomplish the same thing.A woman is hit and killed by a car: We see her body fly into another car\'s windshield, dark blood oozing from her forehead and nose. An SUV swerves in traffic, causing a crash. References are made to hell, and we\'re told the man in the furnace shouted "Jesus lives!" in Russian before he died. (It\'s a code phrase of sorts.) Katya cooks a Christian Orthodox dish, joking with her high school daughter that, "you wouldn\'t know about [it] because you\'re an atheist and you have rejected your heritage." A female Russian agent slaps a male spy across the face, after which the two passionately kiss. There\'s talk of drinking and getting a woman into bed. We hear "d--n" once and "h---" three times.',crime
'scrubs','After a contract battle between the show\'s original network, NBC, and its new network, ABC, the sitcom Scrubs is back in "operation" again. And the change of logos at the bottom right of the screen hasn\'t done anything to scrub this show up. Sex, sarcasm, slimy bedpans and gross irresponsibility still mingle with a few funny lines as Dr. Dorian, Dr. Turk and Dr. Cox return to teach a fresh crop of med students at Sacred Heart, fictional Winston University\'s teaching hospital.Episode ReviewsDecember 1, 2009TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tvpg"Our First Day of School" Now married to their longtime sweethearts and finally done with med school, Drs. Dorian (J.D.) and Turk turn right around and begin teaching other med students.Hold on loosely to that word teaching and cue the latest herd of intern newbies—the bottom-feeders on the med school food chain. J.D. kicks things off by kissing his wife\'s expanding belly and thanking his unborn child for making her breasts so much bigger. Then he and she get a bit frisky in front of said herd of intern newbies. From there, the sex jokes pile up, elbowing their way through dead-man-dying gags. Casual couples decide to shower together (we see them begin to disrobe), sleep together (he\'s on top of her; she\'s in her bra) and sext each other. An anatomy lesson becomes suggestive, and J.D. and Turk fondly recall how their fellow interns drank and hooked up on their first day of school. Chief of Medicine Dr. Cox\'s teaching methods are mostly bullying, an occasional threat and a lot of demoralization. Just for fun, of course. He calls students "murderers in training" and introduces them to the bedside game he calls "Patient Roulette."A student director in charge of morale tells interns not to commit suicide on campus, since it means a load of paperwork for her. Racism is also considered a joke, and there\'s crass humor involving same-sex attraction and male genitalia. Dr. Cox says "good god" whenever he\'s repulsed, and there are frequent mild profanities and crudities ("p‑‑‑ed," "a‑‑," etc.). J.D. is trying to be a good teacher, and he does seem to want to make a difference in students\' lives. But with the terrible teaching he\'s sat under for lo, these many years on NBC, how in the world can he be? Similarly, when a patient whom Lucy befriends dies and unexpectedly becomes her study group\'s experimental cadaver, she—momentarily—seems to reflect on his kindness toward her and the brevity of life. But its the brevity of Scrubs\' healthy scenes that tell me all I need to know about the kind of health care I\'d get at Sacred Heart hospital. It\'s enough to make anybody take up jogging and wheat germ.',medical
'lie_to_me','One of the following statements is false.A) When I can, I spend my weekends hiking.B) I\'m scared of large fish.C) I\'ve seen every Matlock episode made.OK, so what do you think? Can\'t figure it out? Well, don\'t blame yourself. Unless you\'re my mother (Hi, Mom!), you probably don\'t know that much about me. And it\'s hard to pick up dishonesty in the written word. For all you know, I hit the keys a little harder when I lie or write a little slower. But the words look the same.Now, if I gave you the same spiel while we shared coffee, you\'d figure out my lie before I took my second sip. Because I\'m actually a terrible liar.In the ethos of Fox\'s crime drama Lie to Me, we\'re all terrible liars. We reveal our falsehoods with every shimmy of our eyebrows, every twitch of our mouths. These little tics, called micro-expressions, are involuntary—dead giveaways to someone like Dr. Cal Lightman.Tim Roth\'s Lightman is one more of television\'s brilliant-yet-socially-inept mystery solvers. He may be abrasive and acerbic, but he\'s never, ever wrong. The guy heads a consulting firm called The Lightman Group—an organization staffed top to bottom with lie-detecting savants: Dr. Gillian Foster helps smooth out some of Lightman\'s rough edges, while Ria Torres and Eli Loker serve as youngish understudies. Each episode launches this fib-hunting foursome into our land of lies—and judging from Lightman\'s posh offices, they don\'t get paid by the hour.Cases are sometimes ripped right from today\'s headlines and are almost always self-contained, making it seem a bit like a TV network security blanket: You know what you\'re going to get when you watch it. Which is not to say Lie to Me is simple or simplistic. Indeed, the program is sometimes thought-provoking and often aspires to complexity. The good guys don\'t always do good things, and the bad guys aren\'t altogether bad. These messy morality tales, at their best, force viewers to re-evaluate their sense of fair play. And in doing so, they offer this moral message: Lying (even done with good intentions) will lead to trouble. If the Bible says "Thou shalt not lie" (and it does), this show adds, "And if thou dost, The Lightman Group shall catch thee." But here\'s where the show starts rubbing a bit: To get at the truth, Lightman and his team often lie like the dickens—to their subjects (to crack a case) and to each other (you\'d think they\'d be able to catch those). It has other problems, too—most of which are largely dependent on each story\'s subject. In one episode, viewers might be subjected to violent scenes of battle. In another, they might see bikini-clad dancers writhe around stripper poles. So is Lightman and Co. all about "the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth"? Is a TV show ever?Regarding my quiz … I don\'t care for light gray suits.Episode ReviewsJune 28, 2010TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tv14"React to Contact" An Iraqi war vet, apparently struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder, nearly shoots his son while "protecting" his home from imaginary invaders. Lightman discovers that PTSD isn\'t all that\'s eating at the sergeant: He\'s keeping a painful secret buried so far down in his brain that even he doesn\'t know the truth—and it\'s up to the doctor to pull it to the surface. The show features video simulations of and flashbacks to a firefight in Iraq, where soldiers, insurgents and even an armed 10-year-old got shot and killed. One soldier has his eye shot out (blood streaks the man\'s face), and explosions and gunfire pock the screen. We see bruises on a boy\'s arm and hear talk about child abuse and an extramarital affair. Characters curse ("d‑‑n," "a‑‑," "b‑‑tard," "bloody") and make references to smokeless tobacco and alcohol.',medical
'red_bank_society','It\'s The Breakfast Club in hospital gowns, The Fault in Our Stars with a whole lotta company. The Society is a mishmash of seriously sick teenagers all living in a hospital pediatric ward. Sixteen-year-old Leo is the group\'s cancer-stricken leader, a guy who lost his leg to the disease but still has heart aplenty. He once dated Emma, a pretty 15-year-old with anorexia, but she has recently fallen into the orbit of Jordi, a moody newcomer who also has cancer. Emma\'s way with the ward\'s two most eligible bachelors is a constant frustration for one-time drug user Kara—a petulant mean girl who needs a new ticker. Dash gives the ward a bit of freeform levity, despite the fact that he has cystic fibrosis. And all the action is narrated by Charlie, a 12-year-old in a coma.Forced to live together through circumstance and given a sense of solidarity through disease, these kids (with the possible exception of poor Charlie) become friends—almost family. And together they experience as much of adolescence as you can in a hospital, learning a few valuable lessons along the way, often summed up by Charlie in nice, cogent platitudes at the end of the episode. They also get into their share of trouble: They play hooky from therapy sessions or cheat on their diets. They\'ve been known to bolt from the hospital grounds and get drunk. Sometimes they kiss and canoodle, trying to round as many bases sexually as they can. You\'d think their parents would put a stop to some of that but, of course, they\'re typically not around much. Oh, they\'ll show up for the occasional visit, often providing as much strife as comfort. (An example: Tara\'s lesbian moms are at first more concerned with turning her heart condition into a tweet-worthy cause than truly caring for their suffering daughter.) But for the most part, guiding these sick teens to adulthood is the unofficial job of the hospital staff. Nurse Jackson, the ward\'s unquestioned queen bee, dispenses tough-love wisdom with a firm hand, trying to provide as much normalcy as possible. Newbie Nurse Brittany is the floor\'s "good cop"—and a bit of a pushover for her ward-wise charges. The result is a bit like the offerings at a hospital cafeteria. There\'s some good stuff to pick up now and then, but it\'s mostly the television equivalent of mystery meat. These characters learn to care for one another—but sometimes they show it in inappropriate ways. They try to live boldly in the face of frightening challenges—but sometimes "living boldly" takes them into areas where they shouldn\'t be. They\'re learning about life like a lot of teens do, a bit through some wise advice, a bit through trial and error. But the advice isn\'t always great and their errors aren\'t always called out as such. And so this crass catnip for the emotionally overwrought can actually make you feel a little ... sick.Episode ReviewsSeptember 24, 2014TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tv14"Sole Searching" Jordi\'s supposed to have his cancerous leg amputated, but his docs change their minds. Leo, who already had his leg amputated, is understandably angry about this. Kara\'s moms, meanwhile, try to figure out a way to get Kara higher priority for an available heart. "We didn\'t become Out magazine\'s seventh-most powerful lesbian couple in Southern California by working our way up a frickin\' list," one says.Leo and Dash, both 16, illicitly leave the hospital and crash a frat party. Leo drinks heavily and almost has sex with a girl. (The two go into a bedroom where she strips off her shirt and begins unbuckling his pants before he calls a stop to it.) Brittany fetches Leo from the party and, in her nurse outfit, is mistaken for a stripper. (A student asks how much she charges for a private lap dance.) Kara lashes out at Emma for having good parents and tells her that "most girls I know would kill to have an eating disorder." Emma sticks rolls of quarters into her bra so she\'ll weigh more during a weight check. Kara\'s mother refers to an effeminate male nurse as "girlfriend." Teens make crude references to critical bits of anatomy and to sexual arousal. A doctor flirts with a woman at a bar while drinking. A reference is made to smoking. We hear "a--," "d--n," "b--ch," and "d--k" (two or three times each). God\'s name is abused a half-dozen times. ',medical
'royal_pains','Who says doctors don\'t make house calls?In USA\'s light, escapist medical dramedy Royal Pains, Dr. Hank Lawson makes nothing but house calls. He\'s what is known as a "concierge doctor," a physician who brings quality health care right to your door with a smile—in return for a four-figure check, of course. Not that Hank planned to practice his medicine in the well-to-do Hamptons—a near-mythical seaside land so littered with rich people that Fabergé eggs are sold by the dozen at the local QuikMart. Originally an emergency room doc in New York City, he was summarily banished for letting a wealthy man die under his care. Now operating under the umbrella of HankMed—the name being a brainstorm by Hank\'s brother and self-appointed CFO, Evan—Hank serves up the best medicine money can buy. Capable assistant Divya and awkward fellow doc Jeremiah round out the staff.HankMed operates out of the guest house of Boris Kuester von Jurgens-Ratenicz—Hank\'s fabulously wealthy friend, benefactor and patient. But while you can take the doctor out of the ER, you can\'t take the ER out of the doctor. Between making house calls, Hank also cares for the resort\'s lesser-moneyed residents, often free of charge. It\'s a trope that makes Hank feel better about his day job … and it might remove a little guilt from viewers of this guilty pleasure of a show. Royal Pains is one pinch House, three dashes Magnum, P.I. and a whole sloshing bucket load of summer escapism. It\'s as deep as a light sunburn, as provocative as a sensible winter coat. But at least there aren\'t any dismemberments, right? No nudity. No f- or s-words. The Hamptons may be just 200 miles from Ocean City, N.J., but Royal Pains is light-years away from Jersey Shore.That\'s not the complete picture, though. Bikini-clad women have infiltrated the Hamptons like fire ants, and sexual innuendo can occasionally mar the dialogue. Unmarried couples are sometimes shown in bed together. Certain intimate scenes can be suggestive and sultry, if not out-and-out salacious. And occasionally, Hank doesn\'t just make clever diagnoses: He sometimes plunges into a graphically rendered medical procedure right on the spot.It\'s also worth noting that Hank\'s do-gooder mentality has led him to take license with the law—skirting or bending the rules that get in his way. He tries to preserve the medical ethics that are most convenient to keep (he makes a big show of adhering to doctor-patient confidentiality, for one), but he casually dispenses with other standards he feels might hinder him.Episode ReviewsAugust 12, 2014TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tvpg"Good Air/Bad Air" Hank and Divya travel to Argentina with Boris, Hank hoping to help a guy with the same genetic disease as Boris. Jeremiah helps a woman with a mysterious disease, and Evan grows more jealous of Paige\'s work with Ray.Women dance in tight, somewhat revealing dresses. We hear some mild sexual allusions. Ray is shot, and we see blood on his shirt and bedding. A frightening seizure follows facial bleeding. People mislead others—sometimes for good reasons, sometimes for bad. They say "a--" twice, "b--tard" once and misuse God\'s name once or twice. Divya\'s guilt complex and Catholicism are linked. Divya responds by talking about her mother being Hindu. And she says she wants her daughter to learn about all of her family\'s diverse traditions and then "someday decide for herself."June 26, 2013TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tvpg"Lawson Translation" Hank travels to Budapest and discovers that his supposedly dead benefactor, Boris, is very much alive—hiding and trying to figure out why his cousin wants him dead. While there, Boris\' loyal lieutenant (and, as it turns out, brother), Dmitri, is stabbed in the liver. Hank tries to patch Dmitri up, sticking clamps into the open, bloody wound. But it\'s to no avail: Dmitri dies. Boris begins plotting vengeance before Hank advises another, less extreme solution. Divya learns that her out-of-wedlock pregnancy is viable, much to her relief. "I\'ve always wanted this," she says, to her own surprise. "I\'m going to have a baby." She struggles with morning sickness and runs to the bathroom on occasion. Married couple Evan and Paige get three days together, which Paige hopes to use for romantic purposes. Evan, however, obsesses over a village councilwoman who seems to have it out for HankMed.

'the_knick','The first impression of The Knick, the new 10-part drama series that begins this weekend on Cinemax, is that it seems derivative. It\'s about a maverick doctor played by Clive Owen who\'s rude to almost everyone around him — like the abrasive hero of Hugh Laurie\'s Fox series, House. He works at a hospital in a big city, in the shadow of bigger hospitals, fighting for attention and respect — like the doctors on St. Elsewhere. The title The Knick, in fact, is short for Knickerbocker Hospital, and is as derisive a nickname as "St. Elsewhere" was for Boston\'s St. Eligius.But The Knick is set in New York, not Boston. And it\'s not a modern hospital at all, because this new drama series is set in downtown New York City at the start of the 20th century. And in that way, too, The Knick seems overly familiar, because a recent BBC America series, Copper, covered very similar terrain, in both date and place.But here comes a pleasant surprise. Cinemax sent out seven of the show\'s 10 episodes for preview, and the more I watched, the more persuaded I became that The Knick was on a very original journey, and making the most of its increasingly singular cast of characters.On The Knick, the graphic scenes are riveting, says David Bianculli, though at times you may want to look away. Here, Clive Owen\'s character administers a shot.iOn The Knick, the graphic scenes are riveting, says David Bianculli, though at times you may want to look away. Here, Clive Owen\'s character administers a shot.Mary Cybulski/Courtesy of HBO/CinemaxAt the center of all this period medicine and mayhem is Owen as Dr. John Thackery, a medical maverick and pioneer who has more regard for new techniques than any bedside manner. When first we see him, he\'s shooting drugs between his toes, like Mel Profitt on Wiseguy, and exhibiting little patience with the staff — like Lucy, a new young nurse from the South played by Eve Hewson. Even though the setting is a turn-of-the-century hospital ward, the verbal tension may as well come straight from Grey\'s Anatomy.The conflicts deepen episode by episode, along with the characters. The head of surgery, played by Matt Frewer from Max Headroom and Orphan Black, demonstrates early on a risky operation that will be tried, time and again, in subsequent episodes. Each time, it becomes more dramatic and more meaningful. A new doctor at the hospital, played by Andre Holland, is just as gifted, brilliant and innovative as Dr. Thackery — but his skin is black, which makes his circumstances, and his opportunities, completely different. And there are other key characters at the Knick as well — from the heiress who helps fund the hospital to the unscrupulous ambulance driver who helps hunt for research cadavers and other moneymaking opportunities.The slowly blossoming beauty of The Knick, as a TV series, is that it moves in unexpected directions and at a thoughtfully deliberate pace. If you presume Dr. Thackery is going to bond with that young nurse, or the new doctor, right away, you\'d be wrong. And medical cases, which at first appeared to be singular events, turn out to be continuing story lines where we watch patients heal, or fail to. And doctors, too, keep trying new procedures and new equipment in discovering the path to an enlightened new age of medical science.One impressive aspect of The Knick is that it mixes the latest developments in medicine — a makeshift suction device, a new X-ray machine — alongside more mainstream discoveries, like the bicycle and electricity. Director Steven Soderbergh, who last worked for HBO on the Emmy-winning Behind the Candelabra, trusts both his vision and his actors. The graphic operating-room scenes are riveting, even as their primitive and bloody displays of medical technique make you want to look away. And though it wouldn\'t be fair to sample a clip from one of the later episodes, there\'s a point, midway through The Knick, when Clive Owen, in one single passionate scene, provides more than enough ammunition for a shot at next year\'s Emmy Awards. And Andre Holland, as Dr. Algernon Edwards, is right on his heels.Getting into The Knick — deeply into it, where it begins to prove itself beyond doubt — will take two or three episodes. But once you check into this particular TV hospital, and stick around for a while, you\'ll care about the characters, their stories and their amazing new inventions.',medical
'private_practice','ABC wants you to think that its freshman drama Private Practice is all about good-looking, frisky MDs steaming up an L.A. clinic. The Grey\'s Anatomy spin-off is really about social reengineering and challenging traditional morality.This show\'s connection to Grey\'s Anatomy is twofold. First, its creator, Shonda Rhimes, won a Golden Globe last year for Anatomy. Also, Dr. Addison Forbes Montgomery (actress Kate Walsh) bridges the two series as a physician with lots of, shall we say, baggage. Addison has left Seattle Grace Hospital and retreated to L.A. to recover from dented relationships and a destroyed marriage. She decided to join recently divorced med school pals Naomi and Sam Bennett in a private-practice venture conceived to provide patients with whole-body care. Her surgical and gynecological skills are complemented by Naomi\'s fertility specialty and Sam\'s self-help bent. They\'re joined by a pediatrician, a psychiatrist and a master of alternative medicine.Trading Anatomy\'s quirky, mildly comedic style for über-serious drama may not win a wider swath of fans, but it gives more weight to the social issues Rhimes chooses to champion. Which brings us back to the show\'s morality. An early episode, for example, applauded a 10-year-old boy for asking his male crush out on a date. After being beaten up and experiencing a crisis of confidence, the confused child is told by his pediatrician, "I wish I was you. … You\'re a lot braver than I am. … You are young—you will have a lot of chances to fall in love with someone who is really into you big time."Similarly destructive is the ambivalence toward marriage by psychiatrist Dr. Violet Turner (Judging Amy\'s Amy Brenneman). She actually reprimands a patient for choosing to stick it out with his wife and abandoning all of the "progress" he has made over years of therapy.Mixed throughout are steamy sex scenes, partial nudity and frank discussions of anatomical functions. Turner is especially vocal in her support of women giving in to masturbatory fantasies, as well as recreational sex between strangers. "It\'s empowering for women, actually, casual sex," she said. "It can be, as long as the boundaries are clear. Whatever helps you scratch the itch is fine."What does disgust Dr. Turner? A man\'s proclivity to insert shoes into his body cavities. Apparently everyone (including network TV producers) draws the line somewhere. That line just keeps moving, due in large part to shows like this one."Ultimately, asking if Private Practice is good is like asking if a Twinkie is good," wrote Salon\'s Heather Havrilesky. "The answer is \'No\' and \'Of course!\' and, also, \'Give me another one.\'" Which is why this melodramatic show has the power to influence a lot of people hungry for multiple helpings of sinfully rich moral upside-down cake.',medical
'greys_anatomy','In 2010, the Association of American Medical Colleges said the United States faced a shortage of 150,000 doctors over the next 15 years. Here\'s a plan to stop the bleeding: Why not recruit the cast of ABC\'s hit dramedy Grey\'s Anatomy? They seem young, smart and really driven—despite their sophomoric spats, occasional heavy drinking and manifold sexual exploits. And the interns and doctors at, first, Seattle Grace Hospital, now Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital, sure look like they know how to practice medicine, dealing hourly—and usually brilliantly—with life-or-death situations. Right.Grey\'s Anatomy\'s cast is broad, varied and worthy of a soap opera (which, of course, is exactly what Grey\'s is). Meredith Grey, Cristina Yang, April Kepner and Alex Karev are all surgeons who have battled their way through various professional and personal trials. Dr. Owen Hunt, a trauma specialist and Iraq War vet, is Cristina\'s ex-husband and still sometime lover. Callie Torres and Arizona Robbins are orthopedic surgeons and lesbians who recently married. Dr. Derek Shepherd, Meredith\'s husband, is chief of surgery. Dr. Miranda Bailey, an attending surgeon, and former hospital chief Richard Webber try to keep everyone in line. Between rounds, this motley yet highly telegenic group grapples with friendships, romance, dysfunctional families and conundrums about their own competence. (In fact, they often struggle with these things during their rounds.) And when they\'re not agonizing, they find time to swap innuendo-laden banter, engage in quick couplings with one another (and sometimes patients), and mull the muddy meaning of life and love. These interns aren\'t just learning how to operate on patients, then, they\'re trying to figure out how to operate in life—crafting community, balancing work and play, and seeking happiness in a demanding profession. But their choices often lead to ethically impaired life lessons and disastrously misinformed spiritual beliefs. In other words, the word Grey in the show\'s title could easily refer to its characters\' morals as well. And then there\'s the gore, shown up close and in living (or deceased, as the case may be) color. Mangled body parts—be they torn, punctured, bitten off or atrophied—are pictured in grisly detail. Rare diseases sometimes manifest in horrifying ways. Similarly dreadful are the ways doctors address these situations with sitcom-style yuks. That\'s not to say Grey\'s Anatomy doesn\'t have some serious points to make. It does. But it seems every time the show tries to make a poignant statement about self-sacrifice or forgiveness, that heartfelt moment gets derailed by flashes of partial nudity or explicit sexual humor involving masturbation, erections or vaginas.Creator and executive producer Shonda Rhimes chalks it up to a "realistic" portrait of doctors. "Some medical shows keep them as heroes, and some medical shows go with pure adrenaline drama," she says. "But Grey\'s Anatomy is trying to walk the line in the middle and give you a little bit of both."The result is a perennial hit, and many of Grey\'s Anatomy actors have gone on to impact other shows or films. Katherine Heigl, for instance, played Dr. Izzie Stevens for years before making a splash in the world of cinematic romcoms. Sarah Drew, who plays the Christian doctor April Kepler, also took a starring turn in the 2014 Christian comedy Moms\' Night Out. In both roles, Drew—a Christian herself—says that she\'s done her best to portray Jesus-followers as real, genuine people, not preconceived notions of what sitcom fans might expect or sometimes see on the news."I know in our mainstream culture, the loudest voices and the most shocking voices are the ones that get the noise," she told Fox News. "But the problem is, people think that\'s how all Christians behave if they don\'t know any Christians." As nuanced as she might try to make her character, though, the shock she talks about also rules on her own show. Sex, gore and bad behavior are everyday occurrences in the workaday world of Grey Sloan Memorial. And that\'s far from a healing environment.Episode ReviewsMay 8, 2014TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tv14"Everything I Try to Do, Nothing Seems to Turn Out Right" April and Jackson, who secretly eloped, are now expecting (and keeping the babe under wraps, too). Callie, meanwhile, discovers she can no longer carry a baby—a sad realization for her and her wife, Arizona, who discuss the matter in bed (and kiss). Cristina and Owen share a passionate smooch or two. Bailey is in trouble for giving a child a risky stem cell treatment involving the HIV virus—against the parents\' wishes. The boy is cured, but the parents threaten to take Bailey\'s medical license before an intern lies to save Bailey\'s bacon. Alex steals a patient from Arizona: We see them both operating on the contested boy. (Intestines are exposed.) An intern cares for a baby whose organs were born outside the body. The protective casing breaks, causing the organs to spill and necessitating emergency surgery.A professional dancer suffers from a problematic sphincter, causing serious issues with her bowel movements. In every scene she passes noisy, embarrassing gas. We hear about how she defecated in the middle of a rehearsal, grossly describing the mess as "frickin\' spin art." We hear other crude references to feces and anatomical areas. April is jokingly threatened with a medical drill. There\'s a quip about suicide. Characters routinely say things like "d‑‑n," "h‑‑‑," "a‑‑" and "b‑‑ch." They misuse God\'s name a couple of times.October 7, 2010TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tv14"Superfreak" Most of the doctors, still dealing with the aftermath of last season\'s violent carnage, have been cleared for surgery following the shooting. But Christina is suffering post-traumatic stress disorder and has to practice on cadavers. Dr. Robbins forces Alex to take the elevator where he almost bled to death in order to face his fear. A grossly deformed "tree man," covered with large warts, becomes an object of derision. Docs mock two virgins in their late twenties, later talking about their own first sexual experiences as teens. Several doctors lightheartedly scold a peer for getting emotionally involved with a man after having sex with him, suggesting she should have been "cool," "strong" and more detached. A patient who inhaled a condom while practicing oral sex with a banana has a lung abscess. Callie and Arizona are shown making out, beginning to undress each other (in front of their roommates) and rushing to their bedroom to have sex. Several doctors get tipsy at a bar while—and here we go again—mocking the virgin doctor among them. Surgery is graphic. Language includes "a‑‑," "d‑‑n," "b‑‑ch" and "h‑‑‑." "Frickin\'" stands in for the f-word, and God\'s name is abused multiple times.',medical
'nurse_jackie','First "Dexter," now "Nurse Jackie."Showtime is in danger of becoming a network that clings to its onetime hits for several seasons longer than it should.Not only is "Nurse Jackie" back for a sixth season that takes the story of drug addict ER nurse Jackie Peyton (Edie Falco) back to where she started in season one -- she\'s popping pills like they\'re M&Ms again -- but Showtime already renewed the series for a seventh season.Too bad. Running a show into the ground only hurts its legacy. Look no further than "Dexter," which ran too long and got saddled with a terribly dull, unsatisfying ending, for proof.As season six begins (9 p.m. Sunday), Jackie is still with her cop boyfriend, Frank (Adam Ferrara), but unbeknownst to him, she\'s back on drugs even while attending AA meetings.Jackie is also estranged from her daughters in ways that don\'t mesh with the character as established in earlier seasons. Even when Jackie was on drugs previously, she always stayed on top of what was happening with her kids; it stretches credulity that she\'s surprised to learn her oldest daughter is in an AP biology class.Another head-scratcher: Jackie scams her way into getting an OxyContin prescription but doesn\'t seem to know that in New York there\'s a 24-hour waiting period before she can pick it up. Really? Isn\'t that the sort of thing any experienced drug addict, especially one who is a nurse, would know?At one time, it was possible to enjoy "Nurse Jackie" even for viewers who were over Jackie\'s drama because the supporting cast was so much fun. But there\'s something less entertaining about them these days, too. Their plots sometimes feel like a stretch, as if the writers are grasping for stories for them.In the new season\'s first two episodes, the show\'s writers introduce a new friend for Jackie, an understandable development after the departure of Dr. O\'Hara (Eve Best) last season.Like O\'Hara, this new friend, Antoinette (Julie White), is outspoken with a self-proclaimed "big personality." But the writers try to change up the dynamics of the friendship by making Antoinette part of Jackie\'s AA group, allowing Jackie to be more honest with this new character than she can be with her work colleagues. She comes clean quicker to Antoinette than she did to O\'Hara. It\'s a welcome effort to try a twist on what worked in the past, but at this point in the show\'s life there\'s not much that hasn\'t been done.Sevigny in new pilotAs if we need further proof that shot-in-Pittsburgh "Those Who Kill" won\'t be back for a second season, this week the show\'s star, actress Chloe Sevigny, signed on to a new pilot, Amazon.com\'s "The Cosmopolitans" from director Whit Stillman ("Metropolitan")."The Cosmopolitans" stars Ms. Sevigny as a part of a group of American expatriates living in Paris. Adam Brody ("The O.C.") also stars in the series that begins production this month in Paris.Technically, Ms. Sevigny is still committed to "Those Who Kill," which has not been officially canceled. Actors on series that seem marginal to continue will often land jobs in new pilots where they are considered in "second position," meaning if the first, likely-to-be-canceled series is somehow renewed, they will have to fulfill that commitment and producers of the new series will have to recast and re-film scenes.Amazon is gambling that "Those Who Kill" will not continue beyond its first season, now airing at 10 p.m. Sunday on LMN, which seems like a pretty safe bet.Cornerstone Network at 35Wall-based Christian broadcaster Cornerstone TeleVision (WPCB, Channel 40) celebrates the 35th anniversary of its Cornerstone Network with an on-air celebration (8 p.m. Saturday on "Real Life").At 10 a.m. May 7, WPCB will debut a new program, "Sister 2 Sister," which expands from a segment to become its own series.WQED\'s education effortsFormer WQED chief operating officer Mel Ming, who worked at Pittsburgh\'s PBS station from 1994-96 and is now CEO of "Sesame Street" producer Sesame Workshop, returned Thursday for a presentation to funders, foundation representatives, educators and state representatives about the importance of educational partnerships.WQED executive director of educational partnerships Jennifer Stancil presented details of outreach efforts that resulted from a state education grant, including contact with at least 3,161 teachers, parents and care providers.Mr. Ming emphasized the importance of the local component of "Sesame Street\'s" efforts, saying that all the educational content in the world won\'t do any good if viewers can\'t receive it from an outlet such as WQED."That last mile of distribution is getting it into the home," he said.

'er','"ER" is arguably the best major health care-related television series since "M*A*S*H," and it is one of the most medically realistic dramatic series ever. When "ER" leaves prime time after well over a decade on the air, it will also have been one of the most popular shows in history. It will likely continue for years in syndication around the world. Accordingly, it will continue to have a tremendous influence on how the global public views health care, including nursing. "ER" has generally portrayed nurses as competent, caring health workers and avoided the most obvious stereotypes. But the show\'s physician-centric approach has led to a continuing failure to give viewers an accurate or complete picture of the vital role nursing actually plays in modern health care. Throughout the show\'s run, only one of its eight to ten major characters has been a nurse, with the rest physicians or medical students. The few nurses who do emerge from the wallpaper tend to be skilled, but fungible. With rare exceptions, they serve as subordinates and romantic foils for the heroic physicians, who consistently do key care tasks that nurses do in real life.Since its inception in 1994, "ER" has focused on the professional development and personal lives of a shifting cast of emergency department (ED) and surgical physicians, and the personal life of one ED nurse, at "County General," the main public hospital in Chicago. Keys to the show\'s success have been its adrenaline-happy depiction of emergency procedures, complete with whirling camera work and faster-than-the-speed-of-light technical dialogue, an addictive soap opera approach to the intersecting lives of the main characters, and an amazing ability to regenerate itself with new characters--by the start of the 12th season, none of the original major characters remained. In addition, unlike some popular hospital dramas, "ER" has grappled seriously with many of the thorny issues raised by modern health care. It has also featured some inventive plotting, strong characters, good direction and fine acting. In recent years the show has slowed down creatively, and some digressions into the characters\' non-work lives have grown tiresome. But "ER" is still capable of engaging work, and it remains very popular.Synopsis (series)In its early years, "ER" introduced the model that would prove so effective: dedicated, intelligent physicians staggering under the volume and complexity of cases seen in a public Level One Trauma Center, and trying to cope with the effects on their professional and personal lives. The show\'s plot is too intricate to summarize fully here, but major characters in the early years included: John Carter (Noah Wyle), a wide-eyed medical student from a wealthy family who would ultimately become chief ED resident, and who may end up as the most important character in the show\'s history; Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards), a sensitive, decent ED chief resident whose marriage to an attorney ultimately fell apart and who became, as an attending, the show\'s moral center; Kerry Weaver (Laura Innes), an insensitive, physically disabled ED senior resident who consistently put herself before her colleagues, and became chief of emergency medicine; Carol Hathaway (Julianna Margulies), whose suicide attempt was featured in the series premiere, a tough and committed ED nurse who became a nurse manager; Doug Ross (George Clooney), a hunky pediatric ED resident whose maverick ways would eventually lead to his departure from the hospital and the show, followed by long-time flame Hathaway; Peter Benton (Eriq La Salle), a coldly intense surgical resident who seemed to have a maximum allotment of one smile per season, which he didn\'t always use; Jeanie Boulet (Gloria Reuben), an earnest, HIV-positive physician\'s assistant; Susan Lewis (Sherry Stringfield), a down-to-earth ED resident who would leave the show for several seasons; Elizabeth Corday (Alex Kingston), a skilled English surgeon who would ultimately marry Greene; and the great Robert Romano (Paul McCrane), an acid-tongued, highly skilled surgical attending who would become the chief of medicine and who served, along with Weaver, as the show\'s enduring character-you-love-to-hate.As the show got deeper into its first decade, these characters began to leave and be replaced, a process that has never stopped. Ross and later Hathaway departed for the Northwest to raise their twins, and Benton left for a job that would allow him to care for his young son. Perhaps most significantly, Greene succumbed to brain cancer, leaving Corday to raise their young daughter alone. Corday returned to County and stayed for some time. But she eventually quit and returned to England rather than accept a demotion for performing a noble but illegal organ donation between two HIV-positive people. Romano lost his arm to a helicopter rotor. Then he spiraled downward, unable to regain his surgical ability, until the show finally killed him off--by having a helicopter fall on him. Lewis returned and later became chief of emergency medicine. But she struggled to be taken seriously, and eventually left for Iowa with her flight nurse boyfriend and their baby, miffed at having been denied tenure. Weaver took advantage of Romano\'s decline to become chief of medicine, meanwhile coming out as a lesbian and having a baby with her firefighter partner, who soon died in the line of duty. Weaver carried on raising their baby, and eventually had a hip replacement that allowed her to walk unaided.The show anointed Carter, now ED chief resident, to be Greene\'s successor as its moral and professional heart. In the middle years of the show, Carter thrived professionally, becoming an attending. But he did not do as well in his personal life, getting close to a marriage proposal to newcomer Abby Lockhart (right) (Maura Tierney) before pulling back, and making several soul-searching trips to provide care in war-torn Congo. Carter returned from one of these with new girlfriend Kem. Their baby was stillborn, and Kem fled, but Carter eventually realized his heart was no longer in Chicago. He left to join Kem at the end of the 11th season, though he returned in the 12th season for a few episodes set in Darfur (Sudan).Lockhart became the show\'s most important character as Carter faded. At first, Lockhart was a somewhat confused, alcoholic OB nurse who was attending medical school. Then she settled in as the post-Hathaway major ED nurse character, and appeared committed to nursing. Then she reversed course again and went back to medical school. Lockhart stayed in the ED as an intern and then a resident, eventually becoming involved with newcomer Luka Kovac (Goran Visnjic). Kovac was a Croatian ED attending who replaced Ross as the show\'s designated hunk, but who had difficulty overcoming the death of his wife and children in the Balkans war. By the end of the 12th season, Lockhart and Kovac were expecting a baby, Lockhart was an increasingly assertive resident, and Kovac had replaced Lewis as chief of ED medicine.The post-Lockhart major nurse character has been tough young single mother Sam Taggart (Linda Cardellini). Taggart is highly skilled. But most of her early plotlines focused on her romance with Kovac, and their joint efforts to raise her son Alex in spite of the negative influence of his father--a violent criminal who ultimately escaped from prison and kidnapped Taggart and their son, before Taggart herself executed him with his own gun. Taggart became assistant nurse manager in the early 12th season episodes with the highly skilled, aggressive ED nurse manager Eve Peyton. But Taggart\'s new role seemed to evaporate with Peyton\'s abrupt firing for decking an offensive patient on Christmas Eve.Other new characters arrived, and some stayed. Jing-Mei Chen (Ming-Na), a contemporary of Carter\'s who had briefly appeared on the show near the start, returned as a resourceful but troubled senior resident. After a time she quit the ED to care for, and ultimately euthanize, her failing father. Michael Gallant (Sharif Atkins) was a bright, decent medical student whose education was funded by his commitment to the U.S. Army. He was ultimately sent to Iraq. Neela Rasgotra (Parminder Nagra) was a bright but bookish medical student who went through her last year of school alongside Lockhart. Rasgotra accepted a prestigious internship at the University of Michigan, but quickly bailed out and returned to County, slowly growing more confident in the ED. Rasgotra also maintained a tentative long-distance romance with Gallant. They actually married, but Gallant felt compelled to return to Iraq, where he was killed by a roadside bomb. Gregory Pratt (Mekhi Phifer), an often arrogant intern struggling to care for his mentally disabled brother, had a relationship with Chen. Pratt later showed signs of maturing, and he became far more skilled, but he refused to pursue the chief resident job. Ray Barnett (Shane West) was a brash young resident who struggled to balance his day job with his passion for playing in a rock band; he became more committed to medicine, and was fired from his band. And in the 12th season, borderline incompetent resident Archie Morris (Scott Grimes), who had been a minor character, became a major one. As the new chief resident, he generally remained an annoying, self-important weasel, though he also showed signs of greater skill and decency.Since the beginning, the show has also featured a diverse group of recurring minor nurse characters. They have included Chunie Marquez (Laura Ceron), Haleh Adams (right) (Yvette Freeman), Lily Jarvik (Lily Mariye), Malik McGrath (Deezer D), Lydia Wright (Ellen Crawford), Yoshi Takata (Gedde Watanabe), and Connie Oligario (Connie Marie Brazelton). These characters have been well drawn, though in contrast to the major characters, we have learned little about their non-work lives. They are often busy at the periphery of a clinical scene, and they have occasionally played notable roles in specific plotlines. For instance, in the 12th season premiere, Marquez and Adams were seen playing a key role in coping with "July syndrome," which occurs each year when new physician interns start work.Portrayal of Nursing (series)"ER" has generally depicted nurses as competent, caring professionals with technical training who contribute to patient outcomes. Unlike many shows, it has resisted portraying them as Nurse Ratcheds, sex objects, or mute ciphers who appear occasionally to execute physician commands. It has shown some nurses to be men and members of minority groups, though all three of the major nurse characters have been straight white females. It has even shown nurse managers, though these depictions have been problematic.Unfortunately, the show\'s limited efforts to highlight the work of nurses have been overwhelmed by the physician-centric vision that has dominated its first 267 episodes. This includes the hopelessly lopsided nurse : physician major character ratio, the regular portrayal of physicians doing and getting credit for exciting, important work that nurses do in real life, the frequent suggestions that nurses are physician subordinates, the intense focus on physician training while nurses\' professional development is virtually ignored, the disproportionate emphasis on the one major nurse character\'s personal life, and the mishandling of slurs against nursing.The Carol Hathaway, Abby Lockhart, and Sam Taggart characters are, along with "M*A*S*H"\'s Margaret Houlihan and "China Beach"\'s Colleen McMurphy, among the most influential portrayals of nurses in television history. The "ER" nurses are capable, nuanced and generally positive. Hathaway in particular was a strong character, and a nurse manager who at a few points actually confronted some real-life nursing issues. Although Lockhart was fairly weak early on, in later seasons she began to show signs of an actual nursing identity, explaining why she chose to remain a nurse rather than continue with medical school, teaching resident Gallant the ropes, and questioning some physician treatment decisions. Unfortunately, Lockhart appeared to grow frustrated with nursing and abruptly reversed course, returning to medical school. That suggested, wrongly, that nurses who pursue graduate education typically do so in medicine rather than nursing. Current major nurse character Taggart is a stronger character with obvious skills and a willingness to advocate for patients, though at first her toughness arguably veered into inappropriate aggression. Early in the 12th season, Eve Peyton made Taggart assistant nurse manager, but there has been no real mention of this since Peyton\'s departure. The recurring minor nurse characters likewise have been shown as caring professionals with skills.Over the years, a few episodes of the show have made some effort to highlight nursing skills or concerns. The Hathaway era included a plotline about a nursing labor dispute, and one episode in which Hathaway (right) had to provide solo care to a critical patient in a dangerous hostage situation. Indeed, as a nurse manager, Hathaway confronted nursing administration over the floating of nurses away from ED, she started an ED clinic and hired a nurse practitioner to work there (that did not last long), and she even quit briefly over the effects of insurance on the ED\'s practice. At one point, Lockhart gave a brief but spirited defense of her nursing abilities, and at times she also engaged the physicians in meaningful care discussions (though her return to medical school suggested that this may have been part of her outgrowing nursing). Taggart\'s plotlines have included one where she provided significant autonomous care to a critically injured rape victim, albeit with disastrous results, and another where she actually made an important catch that an intern had missed--and received credit for it.In its 12th season, the show presented the formidable, doctorally-prepared ED nurse manager Eve Peyton (right). She was not a major character, and she appeared in only six episodes. But it was an unprecedented portrait of a mostly autonomous nursing leader who was more or less the clinical peer of the attending physicians. Indeed, Peyton may have been the most clinically expert nurse character ever to appear on a major prime time U.S. show. She took the nursing staff firmly in hand, doling out advice, holding staff meetings, and telling senior physicians how they were screwing up. The show stressed her autonomy and professionalism. She pushed for systemic change in everything from ordering new supplies for cutting edge procedures to encouraging more hand washing. She brushed back physicians on her autonomy over the nursing staff--and even embarrassed them with superior clinical knowledge. After recruiting Taggart as assistant nurse manager, she briefly seemed to become something of a mentor to the younger nurse.However, these isolated plotlines have been swallowed by the hundreds of hours "ER" has spent telling viewers around the world that only physician care matters much. For all its medical realism, the show remains a victim of what Kalisch and Kalisch have called "Marcus Welby syndrome": the inaccurate depiction of all significant health care being provided by physicians. The show has frequently shown physicians performing critical nursing tasks, such as triage, patient teaching, giving medications, providing psycho-social support, minute-to-minute care of the critically ill, and preventative care such as vaccinations. Nurses are not the only ones affected by this; the show commonly has physicians doing the jobs of social workers and respiratory therapists as well. The show\'s physician nursing is a natural result of its consistent practice of having only one of the eight to ten major characters be a nurse, when in a real life Level One Trauma Center the nurse-physician ratio would likely be about 5:5. The show\'s character ratio would make it difficult to portray the two professions\' roles accurately even if the show wanted to.Of course, the show does have some recurring minor nurse characters. But they have been used mostly to deliver brief patient status updates to physicians ("BP is 88 over 40!"), to absorb physician commands, and to act as dramatic foils for the main characters. These nurses rarely have substantial interactions with patients, and are almost never seen providing care without a physician. To our knowledge, they have not played a major overall role in any episode.Moreover, the show has consistently portrayed nurses as subordinate to the physicians who dominate it, rather than as members of an autonomous profession--as exemplified by its frequent depictions of physicians managing, disciplining, and even firing nurses. It\'s true that Hathaway actually acted as a nurse manager at times in the early years, though she was at times presented as being under the authority of the ED attendings. Lockhart too was dubbed a "nurse manager," though she was forced into it and did next to nothing with the title. Now, it\'s Taggart\'s turn to ostensibly be "assistant nurse manager," but since Peyton\'s departure, Taggart has done no "managing," and it\'s not clear if there has even been a "nurse manager." Not surprisingly, the show has filled this nursing management void with physicians. It frequently tells viewers that physicians direct all care and essentially manage nurses, even if they may have hired some unseen nurse administrator to handle the paperwork. Some might expect better from a show that was created by a physician, and that has counted physicians as some of its key writers.Of course, there were the six Eve Peyton episodes in the 12th season. These made crystal clear that Peyton, as ED nurse manager, did not report to ED physicians. But for a show that airs more than 20 original episodes each year, they were obviously a drop in the bucket. Moreover, the episodes\' depiction of nursing autonomy was itself problematic. It suggested that Peyton reported to chief of medicine Kerry Weaver. And although we were not too concerned at first that Peyton was seen as a rule-bound "bitch"--the show has had its share of physician managers in that mold--Peyton\'s final episode was a crude and implausible swerve into extreme battleaxe territory. In that episode, Peyton got dumped by her boyfriend; decked an offensive patient dressed as Santa Claus and poured his own urine on him, with no physical provocation and no regret; was fired in a matter of hours; and bid farewell to the ED staff with standard PhD-type phrases like "bite me," "screw yourselves," and "you all suck." Peyton was at least fired by a "nursing supervisor" rather than a physician. But the episode spoiled even that nod at nursing autonomy by having ED medical chief Kovac send three of Peyton\'s nurses home because he foresaw a light shift, and call them "support staff" as he did so, with no contradiction.The show has also given viewers little sense of the independent, science-based assessment and intervention that is central to the nursing process. In recent seasons it has occasionally depicted nurses in their patient advocacy role, which can entail questioning physicians\' care plans and catching their mistakes. But this has almost always been when the physician is somehow impaired, as by illness or inexperience; otherwise, the nurses tend to lose out in such discussions. "ER" has not often shown a nurse acting as a primary force in a patient\'s outcome. Instead, with rare exceptions, physicians tend to receive all the credit or blame for the results.Apart from the Peyton episodes, the show has paid virtually no attention to the professional development of nurses, such as through advanced nursing degrees, research or scholarship. Nurse characters have limited opportunities to display their special knowledge and skills, especially since nursing students are never shown. This stands in stark contrast to the show\'s obsessive focus on each stage and feature of the physicians\' professional development, from medical students through the chief of medicine. Tellingly, Lockhart finally chose a medical career and Hathaway flirted with one, as if to prove that they were worthy of the show\'s attention despite "only" being nurses. All three major nurse characters have also spent much of their time in romances with the show\'s physicians, and in a number of episodes, a key role of the minor nurse characters has been to comment idly on the lives of the physicians.The show has also developed a pattern of mishandling slurs against nursing. Typically, it will have a character who is socially unskilled--perhaps an abrasive attending like Romano or Weaver, an unhappy patient, or a visiting schoolchild--express contempt for nursing. Perhaps the character will suggest that nursing is all about bedpans, or call a female physician a nurse as an insult, or suggest that nurses don\'t know anything about the prognosis of a major stroke victim, or express fear at the thought of being a nurse but joy at the prospect of being a physician. In response, a nurse character will look hurt, but she will not say anything. Or the remark will be made outside of any nurse\'s earshot, and no one will question it. The show may think it\'s helping viewers see how hard it is to be a nurse. But the persistent failure to have any character rebut such slurs will likely lead many viewers to conclude that while the speaker may be mean, what he or she says is essentially correct. It\'s just not the kind of thing nice people actually say. There was one notable slur reversal. At one point, Peyton failed to get Kovac to come help a resident with a critical patient. So Peyton did the required cutting-edge procedure herself, teaching the residents as she went, then advised the late-arriving Kovac that if he needed her, she\'d be off changing a bedpan.Finally, though the show prides itself on being on the cutting edge of social issues and has referred to the budget crisis in public hospitals, it has still paid no serious attention to the current nursing shortage or the short-staffing that drives it. This is a shortage that has for some years been a major threat to global health, but that "ER"\'s generally inadequate portrayal of nursing has done little to address. The Abby Lockhart character did suggest in passing in 2003 that lower nurse staffing would likely cause patient deaths --in the context of an episode in which chief of ED medicine Romano had unilaterally fired a number of nurses. And one of the 2005 Eve Peyton episodes included a fleeting reference to the hospital\'s agreement to implement one-to-four nurse staffing ratios. But that seemed to be a quick way to set up new assistant nurse manager Taggart, whose first big task was to fire Haleh Adams for working excessive overtime. That plot also wrongly suggested that the big problem now is some nurses seeking to work too many extra shifts, rather than the reverse problem of mandation, in which hospitals force nurses to work excessive hours in order to cut costs. The real problem of short staffing has never been explored.Over its 12 seasons, "ER" has shown some real appreciation for the role nurses play in modern emergency care. However, that recognition almost invariably gives way to its obsessive focus on the training and practice of physicians. In real life, nurses, physicians and other health professionals have complementary and interdependent work relationships. But on "ER," the bottom line has usually been that the physicians\' role is unrealistically large and robust, and the nurses\' role correspondingly small and flat. In dramatic terms, the physicians are the tragic heroes, while the nurses are essentially members of the chorus.Read more: http://www.truthaboutnursing.org/media/tv/2003prior/er.html#ixzz3UAP8Gzp0',medical
'the_strain','Forget suave. Forget sparkly. The Strain\'s vampires don\'t care what you think of them. They just want your blood. Your body. Your soul.Pretty ambitious for a parasitic worm.The vampires in FX\'s horrible horror series The Strain are infected with said worm—making them not so much creatures of the unholy night as really, really sick patients in a troubled trauma center. The parasites, introduced to New York via an intercontinental flight, infect their human hosts and remake them in a manner more suitable for the invaders: They raise the body\'s temperature several degrees. They cause it to shed whatever hair it has, leaving the skin marble smooth. They rewire the jaw so it can drop farther. That allows a long proboscis to shoot from the mouth and skewer prey, which both siphons off blood and infects the new victim, ensuring the propagation of the species. It\'s a nasty, terrifying disease. But it is still, apparently, just a disease—not some sort of magical curse or unholy condition. And as the parasites worm their way deeper into the Big Apple, a small phalanx of doctors, scientists and latter-day vampire hunters struggle to bring the contagion under control. Ephraim Goodweather and Nora Martinez—doctors for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—are the first to suspect that something\'s amiss. Despite pressure from their bosses to drop the case, as well as Eph\'s familial distractions (he\'s in the midst of a quarrelsome custody battle for his son, Zach), they work relentlessly toward saving this city that, more than ever, doesn\'t sleep. But there\'s something else at work here, too, something ... malevolent. Parasites, by nature, are amoral: They just do what they do. But these scary critters have a Master, a mysterious being who sleeps in a massive coffin. The Master seems to be in charge of the whole works and is served by an undead Nazi named Thomas Eichhorst. A disease is one thing, but a race of bloodsuckers controlled by something close to pure evil? Eph and Nora may need some reinforcements. The Strain is the brainchild of creature-feature director Guillermo del Toro. He co-wrote three novels (with Chuck Hogan) on which the series is based and directed the first episode. And with such a man at the helm, it\'s a given that the result will practically gush with grotesquery. And while the vampires here are as unsexy as a sentient being can be, that doesn\'t prevent viewers from getting an eyeful of side nudity and simulated sex when the blood isn\'t oozing. There\'s quite a bit of bad language, too. You could say, then, that The Strain is in need of a strainer.Episode ReviewsJuly 20, 2014TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tvma"The Box" Survivors are allowed to leave quarantine and go home, much to Eph\'s and Nora\'s annoyance. All is clearly not well. And soon, one of the freed, shock rocker Gabriel, while having a sexual foursome (we see bare torsos and a great deal of near nudity), bites a girl on the neck and draws blood. The women flee as Gabe proceeds to lap up blood from the floor. Elsewhere, another woman realizes blood is leaking from her mouth and into her wine. Eph, Nora and CDC official Jim Kent investigate a corpse and find that the man\'s head has been crushed (blood and brain matter are everywhere, prompting Jim to vomit). A little girl kills her father with her proboscis tongue; the man lies lifeless, half in a bathtub, as blood stains the water. A dead mouse and rat are held up for display.Eichhorst talks with Abraham Setrakian, an elderly professor in prison, and makes it clear the two were acquainted with each other in a concentration camp. Eichhorst tells Abraham that his God is an allusion: "You are not a hero or a savior," he says. "You\'re just a number. I took your name and gave you that number. That\'s all you are." Gabe crushes and snorts erectile dysfunction medication. He talks about his first acid trip. People drink wine, whiskey and champagne. But Eph attends an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting and says of his son, "He\'s all I have left. He\'s my whole world." Characters say the s-word close to 10 times. We also hear "h---," "a--," "b--ch," "b--tard" and "p---." "D--n" is paired with "God." Jesus\' name is abused once. ',medical
'saved','Don\'t be fooled by the title of this show. It\'s not a series based on the 2004 Mandy Moore movie of the same name, nor does it feature any call to get right with the Lord (though one of the supporting characters is Mormon). No, this TNT original series is about medical professionals with serious issues.Wyatt Cole (Tom Everett Scott) dropped out of medical school after two years ("I flunked sucking up"). He\'s still in medicine, though, as a paramedic. His domineering father, chief of medicine at the Portland, Ore., hospital where Wyatt\'s ambulance frequently ends up, tells his son outright that he\'s wasting his life and tries to bribe him into returning to med school. That bribe takes the form of paying off half of Wyatt\'s gambling debt.Which brings us to a major theme of Saved: addiction. Wyatt is always playing the odds, even putting money on whether or not a man threatening suicide will jump. "It\'s not gambling," he explains to a concerned friend. "It\'s risk assessment."His partner, John "Sack" Hallon (Omari Hardwick), is a recovering alcoholic who has a strained relationship with his ex and young son. Wyatt\'s ex-girlfriend and former med-school chum, Dr. Alice Alden (Elizabeth Reaser), is addicted to unreliable men—including Wyatt. And many of the patients they treat have been done in by one form of addiction or another. Shown in quick-cut flashbacks that replay each victim\'s history, we see a grotesquely obese heart attack victim who became hooked on junk food after his wife left him; an OD\'d family man who slowly gave in to the allure of heroin; and a drunk driver unable to give up the bottle who now lies dying, pinned in the crumpled wreckage of his car.Saved pulls no punches when it comes to showing the consequences of addiction. Wyatt\'s gambling isn\'t glamorized, but shown as a weakness. In fact, his rationalizations ring so hollow that even he doesn\'t seem to believe them. Unfortunately, in addition to complex characters and interesting story lines, viewers get rough language, coarse joking and graphic injuries. One gory moment occurs after a man gets his hand caught in a hydraulic machine press. Most problematic, though, are steamy sex scenes, particularly an encounter between Wyatt and Alice in the back of an ambulance. Both passionately strip to their underwear before the camera cuts to the outside of the rocking vehicle.Michael Wright, senior vice president of original programming at TNT, is proud of this new show because, "Like the lead character\'s life and job, the series itself is an ambulance ride: fast, bumpy and full of the unexpected." Therein lies the problem. Despite good writing and above-average acting, Saved will be entirely too bumpy and unpredictable for families.',medical
'dr_house','You want Dr. Gregory House around when you stop breathing or can\'t stop bleeding. But he\'s a lousy dinner guest. The title character in Fox\'s hit drama is a curmudgeonly ball of bile. House hates his patients, mocks his co-workers and can\'t stand himself much of the time. Third-world dictators have better bedside manners."For years television made the mistake of saying: The character has to be likeable," House creator David Shore told the Canadian magazine Maclean\'s a year and a half after the series premiered in 2004. "Well, no, the character has to be interesting. I fully expected to get a note from Fox saying: \'Make him likeable. Give him a puppy. Write him a dying grandmother.\' But I never got that note."House, a medical whodunit once described as "CSI with germs," has developed a loyal following over the years, thanks largely to said sour doctor. According to Shore, House is modeled after Sherlock Holmes, Arthur Conan Doyle\'s brilliant-but-aloof detective. And in every episode, House and his team of medical sleuths tackle mysteries, often saving lives. But their behavior would have appalled Holmes\' Victorian-era audience."Patients die every day," House says. "Not all of them are interesting." He would have you believe—perhaps with some truth—that he cares more about the puzzle than the patient. That he\'s like a big-game hunter on the trail of the catch, and all he cares about is the trophy.We\'ve seen hints that House may actually have a soul lurking behind his tactless rebuffs and four-day-old scruff. But for our purposes, we must take House and his cohorts at face value—and it\'s not a pretty picture. They objectify patients and discuss their own sex lives in graphic terms. They bungle and banter their way through issues of homosexuality (one doctor, known as Thirteen, is bisexual), masturbation and pornography. For much of the fourth season, House referred to one woman as "the cutthroat b‑‑ch." Oh, and he\'s more than a little fond of self-medicating. He kicked his Vicodin dependence for a time, but now is taking a cocktail of drugs—including rat medicine—to handle his chronic pain.House also has a disturbing view of religious faith. "Faith. That\'s another word for ignorance, isn\'t it?" he says. He derides patients\' spirituality, calling them "stupid" and "idiots" behind their backs. He tells a Hasidic Jew, "You will let me treat [your wife], because in this temple, I am Dr. Yahweh." Episodes have challenged House\'s cynical worldview. And while the producers would rather ask questions than provide answers, they do wrestle with moral issues from diverse points of view. When, for instance, House encounters a pregnant woman whose unborn baby was, somehow, killing her, he calls the baby a "tumor" and advises her to abort. She refuses. House then operates on the child in utero to save both lives and, during the operation, the baby grabs House\'s fingertip with his tiny hand. House is uncharacteristically at a loss for words. Trying in vain to shrug it off, he winds up sitting alone, deep in thought, feeling the tip of his finger.If only that was the norm. More representative is a scene (from the tail end of Season 7) in which supervisor and sometime squeeze Dr. Cuddy discovers that House has been encouraging her toddler to watch a foul, sexualized late-night cartoon. The little girl loves the show and parrots its language by calling everyone a "bloody scalawag." "What kind of an idiot lets a 3-year-old watch that?" she gasps. The one-word answer: House. For him, exposing folks to what they ought not to see is just part of the gig.Episode ReviewsMay 16, 2011TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tv14"After Hours" House, worried surgeons might cut off his diseased leg, operates on it himself in his bathtub. He can\'t complete the graphically depicted procedure, however, and has to call for help. Thirteen, meanwhile, cares for her former prison cell mate, who has escaped from jail, promising to not take her to a hospital. A colleague insists she go, however, and when Thirteen refuses, the two get into a physical fight—with Thirteen eventually hitting the floor. Dr. Taub—who filed for divorce from his wife and is now fretting over fathering a child (still unborn) with another woman—goes to a strip club and spots a suspicious-looking mole on one of the dancers. (She\'s wearing a bikini-type outfit.) When he tries to inspect it, he gets thrown out of the club and, later, is again warded off—this time by the gun-wielding stripper.Sexual banter is exchanged. In a hallucination, a 19-year-old criminal gets shot in the head. (We see the wound.) Characters say "d‑‑n," "h‑‑‑," the British profanity "bloody" and misuse God\'s name. Doctors reference why Thirteen went to jail—for euthanizing her brother. House pops painkillers. February 21, 2011TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tv14"Two Stories" House gives a sexually charged "career day" talk to fifth graders, which culminates in a fistfight with another presenter. He\'s sent to the principal\'s office and meets two children, who got in trouble for nearly kissing. The two kids are set up to look as if they\'re in a far more troublesome relationship than they are, with bruises and conversation serving to steer viewers toward the conclusion that abuse and sex are involved. They\'re actually far more innocent than that—or at least they were before they met House. He wonders aloud "who put sand" in a school administrator\'s private parts, tells children about vibrator use and embellishes his speech with tall tales (including one about him shooting a college student in cold blood). Almost as troubling is what he doesn\'t fabricate: stealing and hacking Cuddy\'s computer while searching for ways to "make up" for being a thoughtless jerk. Kids are referred to as "sluts" and "morons." A patient coughs up part of his lung. (Blood splatters out of his mouth and a clump of tissue lands in his hand.) House makes a racially charged joke and talks about nuns doing porn. He and others say "h‑‑‑," "a‑‑," "b‑‑chy" and misuse God\'s name.',medical
'orphan_black','Some people cause their own problems. Others seem like they\'re born with them. Sarah Manning is a good example of the latter.Sarah thought her life was pretty normal—or, as normal as life can be for an amateur con artist. But her perception changed dramatically when she saw her spot-on doppelgänger step in front of a speeding train.At first, Sarah treats the suicide as a great opportunity. After all, it\'s not every day you can so easily assume the identity of another person, complete with bank account and credit cards. But she soon discovers why the dead woman (a Canadian detective) might\'ve been struggling. Seems she and Sarah are clones—products of an elaborate biochemistry experiment—and the realization that there could be scores of her walking around might\'ve been too much for the woman to handle. Sarah, even though she\'s got the same biological makeup, is made of stronger stuff, it would seem.Such is the setup of Orphan Black, the weirdest product to come out of Canada since ketchup-flavored potato chips. Airing on Space in the northern provinces and on BBC America in the United States, Orphan Black has earned Tatiana Maslany raves for her work as Sarah … and Beth, the suicide-committing detective … and Cosima, the lesbian microbiology student … and Helena, the self-harming Ukrainian clone assassin … and Alison, the Canadian soccer mom … and—You get the idea. Maslany has played at least eight different clones so far, all genetically alike but wildly different due to upbringing, life experience and the idea that God must like a little diversity, even in clones. A stretch? Perhaps, but Orphan Black does not shy away from such philosophical musings. In fact, it forces viewers to ask what it means to be human at all. The Dyad Institute, the organization behind Sarah and her kin, sees the clones as grand experiments in eugenics—self-guided evolution, as it were—and monitors them all through their supposed best friends and loved ones. Meanwhile, a cult of sorts called the Poletheans believes these clones to be "abominations" in the eyes of God and sends Helena in to kill them off, one by one. The clones themselves struggle, as you might expect, with their own sense of self. All that helps turn Orphan Black into an edge-of-your-seat mystery thriller, with each episode unspooling just a bit more thread for this sprawling, confusing tapestry. But it also makes for some serious problems. Characters, both clones and non-clones alike, can die in pretty horrible and bloody ways. People are injured and sometimes tortured. Lovers pop in and out of the plot, sometimes participating in graphic sex scenes. Homosexuality is impossible to ignore: Felix, Sarah\'s foster brother, is gay and works as a male prostitute. Cosima is shown in intimate interactions with her lover and monitor, Delphine.

'nip_tuck','So, Nip/Tuck has kind of a terrible reputation in the land of television -- remember all that stuff we said two months ago about this show? Yeah, we were right. And now that the second half of Season 5 is all wrapped up, I think it\'s safe to say that at this point the producers of the show are literally trying to shame the last remaining diehard fans into letting go. I mean really, did anyone watch the season finale last night besides me? Dear God! But hey, Nip/Tuck\'s final season is airing some time in 2010 -- maybe they\'re pulling that old trick of making us hate them so the goodbye will be easier. Guess what, show? It\'s working! For those of you who bailed on this formerly... let\'s go with "watchable" show when The Carver showed up back in 2004, here\'s why you missed the most maddeningly absurd season ever (and trust me, that\'s saying something!).1) Christian has breast cancer.Okay, it\'s not unheard of for a major character on an already soapy show to come down with a fatal disease. But whatever (forced!!!) poetic irony may have come from manly man Christian Troy coming down with what is most commonly a ladies\' ailment was completely destroyed by the following: his getting assaulted and robbed of his cancer drugs by a Craigslist prostitute, his manipulating a breast cancer survivor\'s group for his own libido, and his poorly inserted pec implant going careening off towards his shoulder region in one particularly memorable scene [Editor\'s note: with a nudie floozy! - Mindy]. However, this was the plot point from which all other storylines more or less sprang this half of the season, and the show did sort of manage to make us (at least me) care about Christian\'s impending death towards the end... so maybe this wasn\'t all bad? (Oh, just wait...)2) Christian and Liz hooked up.Yes, Liz is a lesbian. And seemingly possessed of half a brain and a modicum of self-esteem. So why in God\'s name was she shacking up with Christian, who happens to not only be a notorious lothario, her boss, and her long-time friend but also, you know, a man? Apparently we were supposed to believe that his terminal breast cancer and occasional moments of chemotherapy-induced vulnerability were enough to make the steadiest character on this show ignore her sexuality and act like a stereotypical shrewish girlfriend shrieking about "commitment!" and "fidelity!" and "don\'t bang your trashy bar conquests in the foyer when you\'ve invited me over for dinner!" And then just when we thought this cursed storyline was gone for good... she went and agreed to marry him. WHY?3) Major character arcs (and characters) were ignored, multiple times.There was some dramatic stuff going on this season -- Matt questing for his father\'s affection by trying for medical school, Kimber as the Botox-wielding stage mother of her one-year-old daughter, and that 17-year-old wunderkind doctor-in-training Raj joining the McNamara/Troy team. However, none of these arcs were even close to adequately explored during the season (which to be fair only consisted of seven episodes): Matt\'s storyline was introduced and dispatched within a single episode, Kimber\'s arc stopped and started a couple times without going anywhere, and poor Raj stuck around for three episodes but completely disappeared after he purposely maimed himself by slamming his hand in a car door. Perhaps if we\'d had a little more from these second-tier characters, we could have had a little less Liz-Christian action... literally.4) Sean cared about his children even less than usual.At the best of times, Sean doesn\'t pay much attention to his teenage daughter Annie and toddler son Conor. But this season gave them barely a nod, with Julia taking them to New York (and can someone explain why?) in the third episode and Sean just kind of... letting them go. Oh wait, there\'s that phone call Sean gets from Julia a couple episode later about not paying Annie\'s school fees... that totally makes up for it! I mean, these former series regulars don\'t even get to show up in the season finale. Even Christian\'s adopted son Wilber gets more screen time! But maybe this is because the actor who plays Wilber is just about the cutest child ever on TV (yes, Gosselin brood, that includes you). Who knows?5) Big questions from last season were left unanswered... until the third episode, when they were answered way too quickly.Reality check time: Julia LOST HER MEMORY in the previous season finale because she GOT SHOT. By the PSYCHO DAUGHTER of Olivia, her LESBIAN LOVER. These are big things, Nip/Tuck! Don\'t make us wait through two episodes before we find out what the hell happened with all this! Oh right, you had that lame explanation in the premiere about Julia slowly regaining part of her memory maybe sort of. So fine, you\'re ignoring it. We accepted that. But then you went and randomly killed off Olivia on the operating table, blamed Sean for it, and brought back Eden from apparently doing porn in Europe so that she could frame her dead mother for poisoning and shooting Julia before throwing Olivia\'s ashes in Sean and Julia\'s faces???? This is a lot for one episode, even for you.6) The especially cringe-inducing moments.Nip/Tuck built its reputation on risqué envelope-pushing. And since there were 73 scandalous episodes prior to this season, it\'s understandable that 2009\'s episodes would have to stretch to raise the bar on this show\'s shock value. But none of this justifies any of the following antics: the baby fetish of the med student Sean is dating, revealed when she puts a diaper on him during sex; guest star Jennifer Coolidge\'s character discovering her black roots, changing her name to CoCo, and performing in a rap video concerned with feminine hygiene called "Yo Stank"; one of Christian\'s conquests, obsessed with the fear that she will inherit her family\'s breast cancer, chopping off one of her mammaries with an electric carving knife in the McNamara/Troy waiting room; the bizarre dream sequence experienced by Sean after taking Native American hallucinogens in the desert; and most of all, the furniture fetish that compelled guest star Richard Burgi\'s character to make love to Christian\'s couch, among other inanimate objects. Nip/Tuck has gone over the top before, but never quite this far over.7) And most of all...THE SEASON FINALE!Nip/Tuck traditionally goes out with a bang, so it should come as no surprise to anyone that this season\'s finale contained not only cryogenics but also vampires... or "sangs", as they apparently prefer to be called. But these were the least of the shocks last night, because we had to go ahead and choke down the following: Sean\'s new flame Teddy leading a double life as an anesthesiologist in Vegas and murdering her lover with laughing gas; an absurd wedding set to some freaky version of "The Very Thought of You" that actually ends in Liz and Christian yes, tying the knot; Kimber deciding she\'s still in love with Christian (way to resurrect a dead plotline! I knew the vampires were here for a reason...); and Sean becoming addicted to nitrous? Oh, and there was one more little wrinkle. A tiny thing, really: Christian doesn\'t really have terminal cancer! He\'s fine -- the doctor confused his patient ID with a dying woman\'s. So guess what, everybody, everything that happened already was based on nothing. NOTHING! That\'s right, none of the crap we had to endure this season was necessary. In any way. Way to kick us when we\'re down, Nip/Tuck. Way to go.',medical
'the_mob_doctor','What\'s in a name? Plenty. Or so it would seem when it comes to Dr. Grace Devlin, the central character in Fox\'s crime drama/medical procedural mash-up The Mob Doctor.The first part—the "Dr." part—gives us the bare bones basics of the character. Grace is a doctor; a still wet-behind-the-ears resident who has an impressive knack for healing and an equally impressive mountain of student loans. All important stuff, of course, but hardly unusual in a television landscape littered with hyper-talented, overworked physicians."Grace," her first name, offers us a little more insight—the setup, if you will. It seems that Grace\'s younger, slightly shifty brother Nate has a mountain of debts of his own to deal with—gambling losses he owes to the mob. He\'s in so far over his head that the wiseguys decide to kill him, and the only way our good doctor can save her beloved baby bro is by working for the mob on the sly. She\'s taking Nate\'s debt on her own shoulders, which gets to the very core of the Christian concept for which she was named. Then, when Nate\'s original IOU holder gets offed in the opening episode, she remains committed to sticking around town and protecting her brother, even though that seems to require her to keep her shady pact with the mob.Which brings us to her last name, "Devlin," aka the core of the show. Grace showed some grace. We\'ve covered that. But in so doing she signs part of her soul away to the devil. And when the "devil" dies, she signs it over to the guy who kills him—in this case a crime boss named Constantine. If Constantine wants Grace to take someone\'s pulse, she must. If he asks her to pilfer some industrial-strength painkillers, she\'ll find a way to do it. And if Constantine wants her to "accidentally" botch an operation on one of his Chicago-area rivals, well … the implications of what might happen if she refuses are crystal clear.The Mob Doctor sports a bevy of content issues endemic to both the medical and crime television genres. Things get pretty bloody and pretty deadly both in and out of the operating room. Grace has been known to share her bed and her body with her beaus. Frank and evocative discussions about the medical implications of sexual activities—some of them carried out by minors—can get a lot of attention. The language can be rough.Amid all that, The Mob Doctor plumbs an intriguing ethical question: What happens when good people do bad things? It gives us likeable characters, throws them into impossible situations and asks them to crawl through the muck toward some good, even admirable goal. And as they crawl, viewers are pushed past the realm of passive observers into a space where they become virtual judges and juries. Did Grace overstep? Should we give her a pass? Is it OK if she steals for the mob but not OK if she kills for it? And even as we recognize that not everything Grace does can be justified, we almost always root for her (and characters like her) to stay ahead of the law—for the sake of that good goal she has.The questions The Mob Doctor inspires aren\'t always bad ones. But when we\'re asked to rationalize some of Grace\'s bad choices, that can\'t help but encourage us to rationalize a few of our own. And this is an area in which none of us need any extra pushes.Episode ReviewsSeptember 24, 2012TV Parental Guidelines Rating: tv14"Family Secrets" A wiseguy, on the run after killing someone, brags about his prolific drinking, smoking and sexual habits. Grace takes his urine sample (and carries it to the car in a plastic bottle), then smuggles him into the hospital under the auspices of a patient already dead. (A henchman stuffs the stiff in a closet.) We learn that the man\'s wife was poisoning him, and her corpse later shows up in the hospital, missing a finger where her wedding ring once was. A woman wearing a blood-stained wedding dress walks into the hospital, weeping blood. Her examination and operation reveal a bit of skin and some of her internal organs. Someone threatens a truck driver with a gun. In flashback, we see Grace\'s drunk father passed out on the ground, then carted off by mob goons. A woman breaks a window. Constantine shakes down some "business partners" over illegal gaming machines.A couple apparently used drugs to spice up their sex: Grace uses some, a "popper," to rouse an unconscious man. A mafia guy compliments Grace\'s butt. Characters say "b‑‑tard" (once), "a‑‑" (twice), "h‑‑‑" (four times), "d‑‑n" (twice) and "b‑‑ch" (twice). God\'s name is misused. ',medical
'breathless','I saw the WikiLeaks movie, The Fifth Estate, the other night. Benedict Cumberbatch is fantastic but the film isn\'t, for several reasons, one of which is that it doesn\'t really work visually. It\'s a problem with a lot of drama about the 21st century. People now spend their entire lives staring into screens and communicating via text. Looking at a screen of people looking into screens isn\'t a very fulfilling experience. You have to go back to the 20th century to find people actually talking to each other, having old-fashioned touchy sex not Skype sex, expressing emotions not emoticons, and anger in a way that isn\'t snapping shut a laptop. It\'s maybe why there\'s so much period drama about.In Breathless, ITV\'s latest period piece, we\'re in London in 1961. Of course, being about the 60s it\'s already been called the British Mad Men (as The Hour was, and that wasn\'t even set in the 60s). Med Men might be better, given it\'s a hospital drama. And Dr Otto Powell (Jack Davenport) is the Don Draper character – you know, suave, smoking (in every sense), Brylcreemed etc. He just has to walk into a room, and women spread their legs. Well, he is a gynaecologist.Not just a devilish cad though, Dr Otto is also an unlikely champion of choice and performs abortions (still illegal) on the sly. "Otto, is that you, I\'ve been such a silly muffin," he\'s greeted by a silly aristocratic muffin (scone?) with a extra unwanted bun you know where. He\'s kinda Don Draper meets Vera Drake, then.There\'s no such complexity from Dr Powell\'s doctor colleagues. All male, of course, and all randy as Jack Russells; after a brisk, rude group round of the wards, they\'re all off doing their damnedest to hop on and off the nurses like they\'re the Routemasters plying Piccadilly. I say, are you headed for Eros, room for one more on top, eh?So 1961 doesn\'t look very jolly for a woman. The music may be getting a little better, the dresses too. And this so-called sexual revolution is gaining some momentum. Who\'s it for, though? Maybe the pill, which was around then, I believe, wasn\'t in general circulation yet. Because if you join in the revolution, chances are you\'re going to get knocked up by some twit. And if you don\'t get to Dr Otto (who\'s the one you really want to be with) in time, you\'re going to have to spend the rest of your life in the twit\'s kitchen. Quite a cool, 60s kitchen, admittedly, possibly even with a few new electric appliances about the place depending on the salary of your twit – but he\'s still a twit, and his kitchen\'s still a kitchen.Breathless is good at that; the 60s kitchens, the dresses, the Brylcreem and the buses, the Austins and the Morrises, the drink-driving. Also at the paradoxes of the age – the looking both forwards and backwards, the rampant sex and rampant sexism, the shiny new NHS and the lingering stuffiness etc. It looks great, and it captures an age, a fascinating one – key elements in any period drama. Plus there are no screens or texting. You can forget the modern world for an hour (except that you\'re probably tweeting along).But then Downton Abbey does all that too, and Downton is posh froth. What\'s beneath the gloss of Breathless? I\'m talking about the drama part of period drama – its ability to get a hold of you so you become emotionally tangled up, go on thinking about it and the characters, new people in your life, after the credits roll. And I\'m not getting that. Perhaps it doesn\'t matter – you can admire the shine, without worrying about what is – or isn\'t – underneath. Just don\'t go calling it the British Mad Men.Trust Me I\'m a Doctor (BBC2) is brilliant; I learned so many interesting things. Like BMI – the fat thing not the regional airline – is rubbish. OK, not rubbish, but it can be misleading, as an indicator of health; you can be fat and fit. I can be fat and fit. I also don\'t need to drink two litres of water a day. Yay, water\'s boring.I\'m a bit confused about whether I should take a quarter of an aspirin a day: it seems to depend on which distinguished expert you listen to. I\'m certainly going to wash my hands a lot more often and a lot more thoroughly because a third of us have faeces on them … NO! I don\'t, you do, go away. And I\'m going to bed early, because sleep deprivation is linked to all sorts of horrible and life-shortening ailments. Put another way, Newsnight gives you cancer.',medical
'getting_on','As of late, HBO’s “comedy of awkwardness” format has been giving way to the “comedy of exhaustion”—mixed in with a little bit of the “comedy of despair.” Veep is the highest-profile example of this: a sitcom about governance that, episode after episode, demonstrates politics is a brutal business, conducted by beaten-down cynics who ultimately accomplish nothing. The first season of Getting On isn’t as vicious as Veep, but Mark V. Olsen and Will Scheffer’s American adaptation of a BBC Four series does explore what it’s like to suit up every day and go to work under a cloud of futility. The men and women (mostly women) of Mt. Palms Hospital’s extended-care unit fight bureaucracy, faulty equipment, and the limits of modern medicine, which can’t do much more than momentarily stave off mortality for their geriatric patients. Yet Getting On isn’t completely bleak, because the characters have hope—or at least have have deluded themselves into feeling useful.Getting On’s first season got better as it went along, once it established the setting and the personnel well enough to play off of both. Judging by its first three episodes, the second season is going to follow the same pattern. Getting On comes back in a mode so low-key that the show feels inconsequential, setting up a season of diminishing returns. But by the third episode, things really start to click again.The core cast returns for season two: Alex Borstein as Dawn, the ward’s emotionally unstable head nurse; Mel Rodriguez as Patsy, the possibly gay, definitely officious supervisor who inadvertently toys with Dawn’s affections; Laurie Metcalf as Dr. James, a shrill, ambitious academic who uses her patients as subjects for research papers; and Niecy Nash as Didi, who works hard to make enough money to take care of her family, whom none of her coworkers ever bother to ask her about. As the second season begins, Patsy is still trying to impose standards of efficiency and cleanliness on a staff that’s mostly running from crisis to crisis, and Dawn is still trying to tie Patsy down, by suggesting that they move in together.Dr. James, though, is adjusting to a new reality. Her boss shuts down her study of shrinking perineum in the elderly after complaints that she’s making patients uncomfortable with her close-up photos of their genitalia and anuses. In search of a fresh source of funding, Dr. James exploits a loophole in health insurance plans, conspiring with a hospice-care organization to reclassify terminal patients as “hospice patients,” so that she can bill their insurance at a higher rate. In episode two, the arrangement gains the ward an “11th hour volunteer,” played by Alia Shawkat (who isn’t given much to do in her first episodes, but looks to play more of a role in the season’s second half).Season two’s first two episodes—“No Such Thing As Idealized Genitalia” and “Is Soap A Hazardous Substance?”—mainly just reestablish Getting On’s milieu, and neither offers much in the way of a plot. They’re both at their best (and funniest) when they get into the specifics of these characters’ work lives: when Dawn snaps at Didi for dominating a dying patient’s final minutes of life with spiritual questions, or when Dr. James asks Dawn to leap around in the women’s bathroom to keep the motion-sensitive lights from turning off while she’s peeing. Getting On has always captured with painful accuracy how work relationships take the rough form of friendship, but are constantly upended by little power plays. And it’s not just the coworkers who coexist uneasily in Getting On. The show is also very sharp about the awkward interactions of doctors and nurses with their patients, who get treated like children even if they used to be brilliant, respected scientists and writers.In the third episode, “Turnips… North Day… Yes, Yes,” Olsen and Scheffer’s firm grasp on Mt. Palms’ dynamic intersects with an actual story, as the hospital’s computer network goes down at the same time Dawn is dealing with a possibly life-changing health issue. The episode ranges from the wacky (as Dawn and Dr. James rely on faulty wi-fi and a hard-to-understand Skyped-in interpreter to relay instructions to a deaf patient) to the touching (as Dawn deals with her stress by closing the episode with an impassioned, impromptu cello recital). This is what Getting On did so well in its first season: finding small, human moments in the middle of all the darkly comic misery.In its second season, Getting On still gets a lot of comic mileage out of a stuck-in-her-own-head Dr. James chattering away about how she needs someone who can really “sink his teeth into vaginal atrophy.” But what makes the show more than just a miserablist slog is that while the doomed patients and their caretakers alike are mostly just trying to make it through another day, occasionally one of them will plead, “Just hold my fucking hand,” and everyone’s real mission becomes a lot clearer and simpler.',medical
'black_box','There is an unbearable lightness of being thing going on with ABC’s latest drama, Black Box. And I don’t mean that in relation to the book or the movie of the same name, each with its own certain grace and greatness. No, I mean that Black Box is truly unbearable in its wispy, vacuous, pretentious way.RECOMMENDEDBryan Singer Accusations Affect Marketing Plans for Next \'X-Men,\' \'Black Box\'Vanessa Redgrave to Star in ABC Limited Series \'The Black Box\'\'Sherlock Holmes\' \' Kelly Reilly to Star in ABC Limited Series \'Black Box\'MIPTV: Sierra/Engine Seals Multiple Territory Deals for ABC\'s \'Black Box\'I lasted through 32 minutes of the pilot – which was a feat of superhuman endurance, all things considered. My left hand wrestled with the remote in my right hand as part of my brain fought to shut the whole thing off, but the evilness of my right hand won out for those horrifying 32 minutes and now I can never unsee Kelly Reilly dancing like the bipolar imp she plays on Black Box when she’s not being a super awesome “world famous neurologist.”Who doesn’t take her meds. Because, apparently, she likes to dance like the wind.PHOTOS: Broadcast TV\'s Returning Shows 2014-15Few shows are as instantly annoying as Black Box, which sets some kind of record (certainly a personal one) for causing almost instant agitation. Reilly may be wonderful in some other roles, but her combination of sleepy eyes, sing-song little-girl vocal patterns and the show’s desire to have her be both brilliant and also, well, dumb, works completely against the actress.Created and written by Amy Holden Jones, Black Box is ostensibly a series about the wonderful weirdness of the human brain. Reilly stars as Dr. Catherine Black, medical director of a neurological center known as “The Cube” (probably for the same reason the brain is called a “Black Box” – because nicknames are handy and uncomplicated). Black (did you notice that her last name is also like the title? Did you? Did you?!) has a big secret – she’s bipolar. She’s been living with this secret forever and keeping it from her loved ones.Why is being bipolar such an issue when there’s medication she can take to control it? Because she doesn’t like the medication! She likes to flush it down the toilet and go dancing! She wants to see Van Gogh’s “Starry Night” come to life in the skies (which actually happens in the pilot -- and she floats over San Francisco like an angel or Superwoman or something; and yes, it’s just as annoying and ludicrous as it sounds).Being off her meds is “a freaking rocket ride – I’ve never had a better time in my life,” she tells her shrink, played by Vanessa Redgrave, who resists the urge to say, “Oh, you stupid little child.”PHOTOS: ABC\'s 2013-14 SeasonFor a series that tries to take the brain and medication seriously (well, I’m assuming they actually tried – perhaps that’s a flaw in my theory), the stuff Dr. Black says and does is ridiculous. For example, the show pretends that if you skip just one dose of your drugs – voila – you’ll get bipolar hallucinations. There’s no such thing as building up in your bloodstream. Nope. One missed dose and you’re Van Gogh! All you have to do is flush your meds and the very act of them swirling down the drain makes craziness course through your veins and – wait for it – you’ll feel like dancing!Black Box is insufferably trite and never more so than when it decides to show a patient suffering from mental illness which, because this is television, means we can hear the voices they’re hearing inside their heads and graphics can be used to illustrate the fire (and such things) they see all around them. Hokey? Oh, you bet.ABC says Dr. Black “is torn between Will (David Ajala), a sexy, handsome new chef with his own restaurant in Brooklyn, and her co-worker, the charismatic, womanizing chief of neurosurgery, Dr. Ian Bickman (Ditch Davey).”Oy.And yes, the chef who wants to marry her is too good to be true. And the stud surgeon is like a Neanderthal who says things like “I’ve got incredible stats. If I say it’s no problem, then it’ll be no problem.” Dr. Black witnesses him having sex with a nurse. This makes her want to stop her meds -- and dance!With lame flashbacks (her mother really wanted to kill herself – just you watch her say it, repeatedly) and crazy-people reenactments, Black Box is just beyond silly. Add in Reilly’s ill-fitting performance and a need to spin around like a ballerina – free from those restrictive pills! – and you’ve got a recipe for never wanting anyone to find this Black Box, let alone watch it.',medical
'saving_hope','Alex Reid and Charlie Harris share a hospital, a home and a romantic dream. At Hope Zion Hospital, Charlie is the chief of surgery, Alex (a woman) the chief surgical resident. Their flat is tasteful and in the heart of the city. And they planned to spend the rest of their lives together … as doctor and doctor, as man and woman, and finally as husband and wife.But on the way to the wedding, an SUV slammed into Alex and Charlie\'s taxi, sending them both to the hospital … and not to work this time. Alex is just fine. Charlie\'s another matter. Now he\'s in a coma, and it\'s uncertain when—or if—he\'ll ever come out.Not even a coma can keep Charlie from doting on his main squeeze, though. His body may be inert, but his spirit is still fit as the proverbial fiddle, walking the hospital corridors dressed in the same tux in which he was going to get married. So Alex sits by Charlie\'s unresponsive body, telling him her stories and unburdening her heart. Charlie—spirit Charlie—listens and offers what little comfort he can … even if Alex can\'t consciously sense or receive it. But even as Charlie clings to life and Alex clings to their imagined future together, they both have issues to deal with. Alex has to save people\'s lives, battle rivals for her job and make nice with Dana Kinney, Charlie\'s interim replacement as Hope Zion\'s surgical chief. Oh, and she must also work side-by-side with Dr. Joel Goran, her handsome ex-beau.And Charlie? He mixes and mingles with the spirits of other comatose folks. Sometimes he sees them return to life. Other times, he watches them leave for the hereafter. All the while, he\'s looking for clues on how he can wake up—to return to his fiancée in both body and soul, so the two of them can finally cement their vows with the whole "\'til death" part. Saving Hope is a supernatural medical drama—80% ER, 20% Twilight Zone. Television rarely gives us medical procedural ghost stories, so you\'d think this mash-up would be, if not good, at least interesting. No such luck. Saving Hope feels pretty rote, spirits roaming the operating rooms notwithstanding. Maybe we\'ve just gotten too familiar with TV\'s medical manual for anything with doctors and nurses in it to feel terribly fresh. But this NBC/Canadian TV partnership doesn\'t even make an effort to deviate from the script, either in feel or content. Audiences see and hear as much about whom doctors are sleeping with as whom they\'re saving surgically. And one of those doctors—the germaphobic Shahir Hamza—happens to be sleeping with a male OR nurse. We see medical professionals kiss and make out and wake up in bed together, sometimes wearing not very much. And when these doctors start cutting instead of canoodling, the camera rarely shies away from the blood and gore and messy realities of slicing folks up and putting them back together. But while Saving Hope may be both problematic and rote, we would be remiss if we didn\'t at least give a nod to the show\'s (ahem) spirit. While most medical dramas are populated by pragmatic and practical agnostics preoccupied (and rightly so) with the struggle to save lives, this one offers at least a glimpse behind the sterile curtain. It tells us that we\'re made of more than blood and brain impulses: There\'s something more to us, and perhaps there\'s something more waiting for us. Is it an explicitly Christian rendition of heaven or an afterlife? Of course not. This is NBC after all, not GMC. Producers are looking for as broad an audience as possible, so the spirituality presented here is meant to be broadly appealing, not theologically compelling. But having met my share of atheistic doctors on the tube (I\'m talking to you, Dr. House), it\'s encouraging.',medical
'trust_me_i_m_a_doctor','Is a daring extra inch of chest exposure always to be interpreted as the middle-aged man\'s cry for help? Not if it\'s Michael Mosley doing the exposing. In the jaunty opening sequence of Trust Me, I\'m a Doctor, the rock\'n\'roll science journalist casually pulls off not one, not two, but three unfastened shirt buttons.Mosley, I don\'t trust you as far as I could throw you, you saucy devil, and that\'s exactly what keeps me watching. Luckily, this useful magazine-format programme flanked Mosley with three medical doctors who seemed more worthy of our trust. When it comes to health matters, the confused layman desperately needs someone on his side.A&E specialist Dr Saleyha Ahsan investigated whether you really can be "fat and fit" before demonstrating how to perform emergency CPR. Useful Lesson #1: Hum the Bee Gees\' song "Stayin\' Alive" while you\'re doing chest compressions; it has exactly the right beats per minute.Obviously, it was Dr Chris Van Tulleken who drew the short straw in the production meeting. The infectious-diseases doctor was sent out on to the streets to swab 50 strangers\' hands. A third of the samples tested positive for faeces and, embarrassingly, Dr Van Tulleken\'s own hands proved to be particularly pooey. Useful Lesson #2: soap and water is just as good as a fancy antimicrobial foam.It wasn\'t all pop music and pooey hands, though. In America, surgeon Gabriel Weston witnessed a procedure at the very forefront of medicine. A man with Parkinson\'s was cured of his hand tremor, not with a scalpel but with a highly focused beam of sound to the brain. This, then, is the rare science programme that\'s as capable of inspiring wonder as it is of espousing good sense. So trust them, they\'re doctors. But whatever you do, don\'t shake hands.',medical
